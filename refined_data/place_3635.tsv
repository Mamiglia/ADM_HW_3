Atlanta Botanical Garden	{'plants', 'art outside', 'botanical gardens'}	429	683	An emerald gem in the heart of Atlanta, this garden is an ever-evolving horticultural destination. The Atlanta Botanical Garden opened in 1976 with the mission to develop and maintain plant collections for display, education, research, conservation, and enjoyment. It is now 30 acres of lush green and is composed of smaller themed gardens, each featuring a different landscape to showcase a variety of plants.\nThe garden was organized by a grassroots group of citizens who started a petition in the mid-70s. It grew quickly, adding new collections and expanding conservation efforts while welcoming thousands of visitors a year to see the extraordinary flora on display.\nSome notable spots include the award-winning Children’s Garden, the serene Storza Woods, and the enchanting Skyline Garden. The garden is a lovely place to visit year-round and gets quite festive during the holiday season. The “Garden Nights, Holiday Lights” event illuminates the entire garden with festive lights through the chilly winter nights.\nFor those who are interested, they do offer educational opportunities for visitors such as school and group tours as well as gardening classes!	A grassroots community effort in the 1970s led to the creation of this beautiful garden full of delightfully whimsical exhibits.
