Chamber of Secrets Door	{'film'}	201	1040	Visitors strolling down Lombard Street toward Fisherman’s Wharf, will come across a welcome surprise.\nAnyone familiar with Harry Potter will do a double-take when they realize they just passed an entrance to the Chamber of Secrets; equipped with the seven snakes representing the Horcrux. While not an actual entrance to the wizarding world, the door pays homage to the book and film, Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets.\nThe door was created by Steve Penetti as an attraction for tourists who have a love for all things Harry Potter. Unfortunately, you cannot enter the chamber but only pass by for free.	This residential door allows San Francisco muggles a glimpse at the wizarding world.
