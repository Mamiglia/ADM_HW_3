Giant Clothespin Sculpture	{'monuments', 'architectural oddities', 'giant', 'statues', 'architecture'}	79	492	A giant clothespin sculpture that was constructed for the Festival of the Five Seasons in Chaudfontaine Park, resides on the outskirts of Liege, Belgium. The clothespin seems to be holding onto a mound of dirt and grass.\nDesigned by Turkish artist Mehmet Ali Uysal, a professor of art at the Middle East Technical University, the giant sculpture is just one piece in a string of Uysal works that rely on flawless illusion.\nMehmet Ali Uysal was born in Mersin, Turkey in 1976 and now he lives and works between Ankara, Turkey and Paris, France. He obtained his Ph.D. in Faculty of Fine Arts of Ankara’s Department of Sculpture and completed an Exchange Program in 2008 in Ecole Nationale Superieure d’Art de Bourges. Today he is a major figure of Turkish contemporary art scene.\nUpdate April 2022: The statue is no longer in the park. Park is still very nice for walking, running, biking, dogs and nature viewing. It has other statues including an open parasol.	Sculpture designed by Turkish artist and professor Mehmet Ali Uysal.
