The nun will take you down a short flight of stairs and leave you alone, surrounded by skeletons. There are skeletons set in the wall, etched skulls stacked on shelves, bones piled by the altar and made into a cross. Even the chandeliers are made with human vertebrate. A scythe lurks near the altar.\nThe stretcher in the corner offers a clue to the story behind the crypt. The church was established in 1576 to provide a proper burial for abandoned corpses. While it used to include huge vaults where over 8000 bodies were buried, most of the vaults were destroyed during other construction in 1886. This chamber is all that remains.\nUpdate as of August 1, 2016: Closed to visitors for renovations, didn’t say for how long.\nUpdate as of April 25, 2019: Still closed to visitors for renovations.\nUpdate as of July 23, 2022: Still closed to visitors for renovations.
