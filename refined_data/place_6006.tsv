Kavernputt	{'golf', 'ecosystems', 'caves', 'miniature golf'}	74	476	At the visitor’s center of Laurel Caverns Park resides the world’s largest simulated cave; complete with its own miniature golf course.\nIn 1999, Kavernputt was created as an accessible cave experience for those who could not journey through the main caves. The 18-hole course feels, smells, and looks like a real cave. It’s the ideal destination for those wanting to experience the subterranean world, but are unable to venture through the caverns.\nThere’s plenty to learn during your experience aside from improving your short game. Each hole provides educational tidbits, highlighting the various aspects of the caverns.	A miniature golf course crafted inside the world's largest simulated cave.
