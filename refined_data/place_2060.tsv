Casa Diablo Vegan Strip Club	{'erotic', 'Unique Restaurants & Bars', 'food'}	308	961	If you thought the weirdness of Portland topped out at Voodoo Donuts or the Freakybuttrue Peculiarium, meet Casa Diablo, the city’s vegan strip club.\nCasa Diablo was originally a vegan family restaurant named Pirates Tavern, but had little appeal to workers in northwest Portland, who preferred some action with their arugula. So Johnny Diablo, the restaurant’s owner, decided to rebrand Pirates Tavern into something less conventional.\nAside from serving vegan food, the club prohibits its dancers from wearing fur, feathers, leather, or wool while performing. The establishment has been criticized and even sued by people claiming it trades the exploitation of animals for the exploitation of women.	Is this the most Portland place ever?
