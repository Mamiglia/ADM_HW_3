The Museum of Death	{'crime and punishment', 'museums and collections', 'collections', 'memento mori', 'death'}	1758	5831	The Museum of Death, a showcase of just that, was originally founded in San Diego in 1995. In 2000, proprietors James Healy and Cathee Shultz moved the museum to its current location in Los Angeles, and expanded to what is now the largest collection of serial murderer artwork, photos of the Manson crime scenes, original photos from the Dahlia Murders, and other such relics of the violent, fatal and macabre.\nOther exhibits in the museum include the guillotined, severed head of Henri Landru, a body bag and coffin collection, full size replicas of execution devices, mortician and autopsy instruments (and pictures and video of such in use), taxidermy showcases, the Heaven’s Gate Cult recruiting video and more.\nIf you’ve managed to read this far, then the Museum of Death just might be a must-see destination for your inner-ghoul. The museum is a self-guided tour that lasts about an hour, but, of course, you’re welcome to stay as long as you like (if you’re up to it).\n“I think it shocks people, but its a good shock,” said Healy. “Seeing all these artifacts of death in one place reminds people how precious life is.”\nUpdate as of February 2020: The museum is currently closed as they prepare to relocate to a new location.	World's largest collection of serial killer artwork and other macabre exhibits.
