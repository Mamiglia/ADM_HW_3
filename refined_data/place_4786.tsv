Church Rock	{'geological oddities', 'sacred spaces', 'geology'}	497	569	Very near to Newspaper Rock State Historic Monument and the Needles District of Canyonlands National Park, this oddly shaped sandstone formation was erroneously associated with Marie Ogden’s nearby utopian community “Home of the Truth”. The rectilinear opening at the base of the formation was not, however, an attempt to hollow out the rock to make it into a church as local lore would have it (hence, Church Rock), but was in fact dynamited and cut out of the stone by the property owner during the 1940s to store salt licks and feed for cattle.	Oddly shaped rock formation, misassociated with a nearby utopian community.
