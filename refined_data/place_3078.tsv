Barnton Quarry Nuclear Bunker	{'bunkers', 'subterranean sites', 'intriguing environs', 'cold war', 'ecosystems', 'military', 'abandoned'}	120	767	This nuclear bunker is under theÂ Corstorphine Hill, embedded in the Barnton Quarry. It was built in 1952 as a Cold War shelter for the British government and the Queen, should she happen to be at her Edinburgh residence. It was even outfitted with a broadcast room for the BBC.\nThe Soviet nuclear attack on Scotland never came, and thus the bunker was never used. It was a secret until 1963 when a group called Spies for Peace exposed it to the public. It was purchased in 2005 by a private owner who intends to turn it into a museum, although the bunker has long been explored by intrepid spelunkers. (Warning: due to two fires, it is full of asbestos.)	Long abandoned underground complex to keep royals safe from a nuclear war that never came.
