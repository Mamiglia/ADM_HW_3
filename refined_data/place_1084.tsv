Museum of Tolerance	{'museums and collections', 'holocaust'}	936	1327	While not the most jovial of places to visit, the Museum of Tolerance plays an important role in capturing imagery and information about prejudice, focusing on the Holocaust.\nOpening its doors in Los Angeles in 1993, the Museum of Tolerance was established by the Simon Wiesenthal Center, a human rights organization. Aside from its heavy coverage of Holocaust atrocities, it also brings attention to the human rights issues in Latin America and Cambodia.\nThe “Holocaust Section” exhibit, wherein you and the other visitors are divided into groups to play a part of WWII events will be sure to make an emotional impression, as will finding out if the child in the photo you were handed earlier in the tour survived the genocide or not as the visit comes to an end.The museum has an associated museum in New York, and is currently expanding to establish a “Center for Human Dignity” in Jerusalem.\n	A multimedia experience that chronicles the atrocities of racism.
