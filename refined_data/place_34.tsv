The Neon Museum	{'collections', 'statues', 'neon', 'object cemeteries'}	1898	4516	The neon-lit night sky of Las Vegas is one of the iconic sights of the 20th century. It is the peculiar mix of the burlesque, kitsch, and retro-modern that has marked the visual identity of an age.\nMany of the most recognizable neon displays from the golden age of Las Vegas casinos have been produced by Young Electric Sign Company (YESCO). This Salt Lake City-based company has maintained a storage yard in Las Vegas for decades. This three-acre plot has, over the years, become a veritable graveyard of disused neon signs.\nIt is the final resting place of some notable pieces of Vegas history, like the original Aladdin’s lamp from the first version of Aladdin Casino, Binion’s Horseshoe, Silver Slipper, and the Golden Nugget.\nThere are over 150 decommissioned, non-restored neon signs at this location. In 2005, the La Concha Hotel, a Paul Revere Williams design, was moved up the street to serve as the museum’s visitor center.	The neon signs from Las Vegas' past find their final resting place at this unusual graveyard.
