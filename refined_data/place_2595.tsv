Fort Armistead	{'forts', 'abandoned'}	253	839	Fort Armistead was constructed between 1897 and 1901 as a coastal defense base. After the United States entered World War I in 1917, most of the artillery was taken from the base to be used overseas. The base was ultimately shut down after the war.\nIt was briefly reopened from 1942-1944 during World War II as an ammunition storehouse. No longer needed for the global war effort, the base and surrounding area was transformed into a park. Visitors can now fish in the nearby waters or stroll the grounds of the base. Fort Armistead itself has numerous tunnels to explore if you can look past the vast amounts of graffiti and debris.	An eerie, abandoned military base engulfed by nature and graffiti is now home to a local park.
