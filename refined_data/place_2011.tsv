Riot Grrrl Collection at NYU	{'feminism', 'libraries', 'women', 'collections', 'history', 'kickass women', 'punk', 'universities'}	66	973	The Fales Library at New York University has many items of historical and cultural importance, but the Riot Grrrl Collection manages to stand out, in all its punk glory.\nThe Riot Grrrl movement started in the early 1990s as an underground movement combining the rebelliousness of punk rock with the political awareness of feminism. Bands such as Bikini Kill, Bratmobile, and Sleater-Kinney exposed young women to issues that most (male-dominated) bands ignored, including rape, gender inequality, and gay rights. Riot Grrrls would often form chapters and hold meetings to discuss issues and plan political actions, and were a vital component of third-wave feminism.\nRecognizing the Riot Grrrls’ cultural and political influence, the Fales Library at NYU has collected audio and video recordings of shows, fanzines, photographs, news clippings, and flyers detailing the movement. Their most unique item is a filing cabinet covered in stickers and filled with numerous Riot Grrrl artifacts donated by Bikini Kill singer Kathleen Hanna.\nThe Riot Grrrl Collection is made available to researchers and curious grrrls by appointment only.	A collection of fanzines, recordings, and documents detailing the rise and influence of the feminist punk movement.
