The Wreck of the Peter Iredale	{'monuments', 'ships', 'shipwrecks'}	1066	1260	The Peter Iredale was a four-masted steel barque sailing vessel that ran ashore October 25, 1906, on the Oregon coast en route to the Columbia River.\nIt was abandoned on Clatsop Spit near Fort Stevens in Warrenton about four miles (6 km) south of the Columbia River channel. The wreckage is still visible, making it a popular tourist attraction as one of the most accessible shipwrecks of the Graveyard of the Pacific. No one was able to remove the boat, so it just stayed there. Over the last 101 years it has slowly deteriorated.\nOne can still see a very large piece of the ship and during low tide one can walk right up to it.	100-year-old shipwreck you can walk up to at low tide.
