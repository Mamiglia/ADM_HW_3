International Church of Cannabis	{'cannabis', 'marijuana', 'sacred spaces', 'religion', 'drugs', 'churches'}	606	3199	A Lutheran church has stood at 400 S Logan Street in Denver since the early 1900s, but as of recently it has become unoccupied. In April of 2017, the church was reopened as a place of worship for the followers of a brand new religion: “Elevationism,” dedicated to the spiritual benefits of cannabis.\nIt’s only fitting that the home of the International Church of Cannabis is in Denver, a city that is literally a mile high. The church’s overgrown, antiquated exterior is in striking contrast with its flamboyant technicolor interior, complete with a huge “WEED” sign, rows of pews to smoke on, and a neon rainbow mural on the ceiling, which was painted by world-famous Spanish artist Okuda San Miguel.\nElevationism does not have any specific dogma, nor does it require conversion from other religions, so long as its adherents recognize cannabis as a sacrament.\nThe church was opened on April 20 (naturally) and recently launched BEYOND, a fully immersive, meditative experience with projection mapping, laser lights, and sound.  BEYOND begins with a nine-minute guided meditation and contemplative journey through the wisdom of the ages, followed by a 25-minute psychedelic light show set to your favorite classic rock songs.	A technicolor place of worship for Elevationists.
