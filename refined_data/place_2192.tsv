Camera Museum	{'museums', 'museums and collections', 'collections', 'shops'}	135	931	Tucked within the lower level of a charming cafe, this camera museum gives visitors a small snapshot of photographic history. The whole place is a quirky combination of a coffee shop, camera store, and museum.\nThe lower two rooms are packed with different types of cameras, some of which you can even pick up and hold. The various models basically form a timeline of photographic technology, with cameras dating from the 1800s—the advent of photography—up until the modern digital age.\nLondon’s Camera Museum began after one of the cafe’s owners, who happened to be an avid camera collector, decided to open his own small camera shop in the same space where customers enjoyed their coffee and sweets. He later incorporated pieces from his collection into the space, forming the museum.\nEven the upstairs cafe shows hints of the collection waiting down below. Photography-themed paraphernalia covers the walls, which patrons can admire while snacking on cookies and cakes. There’s also a small camera repair shop at the site as well.	This museum tucked below a charming cafe gives a brief snapshot of photographic history.
