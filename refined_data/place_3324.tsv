Buckle Island	NA	50	730	Amid the lush forest and thick brambles that comprise Buckle Island, visitors to this serene escape may notice something out of the ordinary that catches their attention.\nSeashells, tree bark and pine cones are neatly placed on a mossy tree stump. An assortment of sticks prop up a mushroom growing from the base of a tree. After a walk via a shadowy path flanked by dense foliage, a green door is situated between two trees. Stepping through the door unlocks a less-dense part of the forest and boundless light; a bridge between light and dark.\nNo need to be alarmed though. Anything that appears out of the ordinary or unnatural on this uninhabited island is there for entertainment and enjoyment, not to deter or scare visitors. Some who travel to Buckle Island, located off the northwest coast of Swans Island, Maine, create various natural pieces of art and mementos left for those who follow.\nIf you ever have the chance to visit Buckle Island, be sure to create your own piece of artwork to leave your eco-friendly mark for other visitors to see and enjoy.	This uninhabited island in Maine is home to various works of art left by visitors over the years.
