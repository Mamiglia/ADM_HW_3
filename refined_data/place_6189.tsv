Fong's Pizza	{'Unique Restaurants & Bars'}	484	466	A late-night pizza joint housed in the former digs of Des Moines’ oldest Chinese restaurant. They have opted to keep the past resident’s choice of decor.\nWalking through the door makes one reminiscent of a 1950’s Chinese diner. Their most popular pizza is the Crab Rangoon, while they have seasonal options such as a Corn Dog pizza during the Iowa State Fair.\nThen, there are the libations. Tiki drinks served in ceramic monkey heads or ships come with multiple straws and are shared among your table mates. Order yourself a “kamikaze” drink and they will give you a helmet to wear to enhance the experience.	A popular pizza place that chose not to replace the original tenant's Chinese restaurant decor.
