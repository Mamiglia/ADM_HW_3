The Grave of XYZ	{'crime', 'banks', 'mystery', 'gravestones', 'graves'}	112	512	They were a gang of four: bank robbers who set their sights on the Deep River Savings Bank a year before they arrived that cold December night. Once the shooting was over, the number was down to three.\nThe lead man, caught trying to pry open one of the bank’s tall windows, was shot and killed. With a body unclaimed by family or friend, the town buried him in Fountain Hill Cemetery where his small block of a headstone sits in a remote corner. It’s marked only with the initials “XYZ.”\nIt was the winter of 1899, and the bank had been tipped off a year before to a possible robbery. They were ready with a hired guard, a local man named Harry Tyler who was vigilant and good with a gun. How the bank knew so far in advance isn’t quite clear, but they put Tyler on the case, and every night he sat, waiting for something to happen.\nOn December 13th the four showed up, including one “deep-dyed criminal” (that’s what the paper called him) with a long black mustache. After Tyler’s one shot, the other three scattered, never to be caught. The unidentified man was buried in a donated plot near the railroad tracks.\nShortly after the burial Tyler received a letter, anonymous, but in a woman’s handwriting. She asked that the grave be marked only with the letters XYZ, and the cemetery complied: first with a simple engraved cross, and eventually with a small stone.\nThe mystery of XYZ grew over time, kept alive by the yearly sighting of a woman in black who arrived at Deep River Landing every December. Without a word spoken, it’s said she would walk the tracks from the tiny station to the cemetery, only a mile or so away, visit the grave, and leave a small flower. For 40 years people claimed to see her.\nThe legend of XYZ is well known in this small Connecticut town, and most claim that the bank robber’s name has always been a mystery. But a look back at newspaper coverage did finally identify him: a professional criminal named Frank Howard, who went by several other names over the course of his career. But the one name that stuck has only three letters.	The mysterious headstone of an unidentified bank robber was seen visited, every year, by a woman in black.
