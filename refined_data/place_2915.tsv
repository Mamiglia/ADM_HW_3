Idaho Potato Museum	{'food', 'collections', 'food museums', 'potato museums', 'museums', 'museums and collections'}	339	788	This museum highlights the agricultural and commercial history of potatoes. It features a giant potato sculpture and also serves as the home of the world’s largest potato chip, a 25-inches long Pringle dating from 1991.\nLay’s slogan “betcha can’t eat just one” is exemplified in this local museum filled wall-to-wall in potato paraphernalia. From the moment you step through the door (adjacent to a several-foot-long baked potato with a permanent tripod to commemorate your trip) and pay the entry fee (and receive a potato sack with a box of hash browns), you are inundated with starchy goodness.\nThe museum offers information and entertainment for all ages, with examples of products, a build-your-own Mr. Potato Head Station, and animatronic potato people. The gift shop offers an array of cheesy potato-themed products to take home, such as shirts with Da Vinci’s Vitruvian Man replaced with a potato.\nConnected to the museum is a cafe serving potato products and ice cream.	This museum glorifies the humble potato.
