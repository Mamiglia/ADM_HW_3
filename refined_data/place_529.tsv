Virginia's Natural Tunnel	{'natural wonders', 'nature', 'natural history'}	329	1854	A stream flows through the tunnel alongside railroad tracks that have been in use for well over a hundred years. Sometimes mistaken for Natural Bridge near Lexington, VA, Natural Tunnel, however, is more impressive to some.\nThe railroad is still in useâ€”in fact, trains occasionally cross the path to the viewing platform near the tunnel entrance, so pay attention to the signals. This means that the closest you can get to the railroad is the platform, except for one day a year: Railroad Day. On Railroad Day, the railroad voluntarily shuts down and park visitors are allowed to walk through the cave. Lighting is operated by the park, and visitors walk directly on the tracks. Turns out there is light at the end of the tunnel.	A 300-yard long natural tunnel runs through a ridge deep in the Appalachian Mountains.
