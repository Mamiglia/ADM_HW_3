Abandoned Wonder Bread Factory	{'history', 'industrial', 'abandoned', 'factories'}	153	602	The Wonder Bread factory, built in 1923, was once an industrial icon of Buffalo’s East Side. While it was in operation, the facility produced that classic midcentury staple, as well as Hostess brand snacks. The first floor held massive Wonder ovens, making the surrounding neighborhood smell faintly of bread.\nThe 180,000-square-foot, steel-reinforced concrete building was built with tall ceilings, large south-facing windows, and an open layout to maximize the natural light. The blond brick exterior was topped with Roman arch-style windows that were popular with mill buildings in the late 19th century.\nThe factory closed in 2004, and has sat empty ever since, in an ever-worsening state of decay. Around 2010 (the same year the building was listed for sale for $800,000), the letter “B” from the giant “Wonder Bread” sign at the top of the building mysteriously went missing. Some months later, the “N” followed, and later the “E.”\nThe factory remains abandoned today, with just enough fading letters intact to make out its former name.	A forsaken wonder in the middle of the East Side neighborhood.	['Buffalo Central Terminal', "The Relic Collection at St. John Gualbert's Church", 'The Darwin D.
