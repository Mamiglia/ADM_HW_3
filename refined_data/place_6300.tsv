Natural Arch Bridge	{'urban planning', 'rock formations', 'bridges', 'villages', 'infrastructure'}	16	458	Most of the small, medieval village of Puentedey, located in Spain’s Burgos province, sits on top of this impressive natural limestone arch . The name of the village translates to “God’s Bridge,” and it’s pretty easy to see why.\nThe arch formed when the Nela River abandoned a long meander by carving its way though the hill. A fairly broad footpath runs through the arch alongside the river, which is clear and inviting. And just inside the arch, you’ll find a small, sandy beach that’s the perfect spot for relaxing in the shade.\nYou can walk right through the arch and out the other side easily. It has several openings which discharge water during wet weather, sometimes quite impressively. Within the roof, there’s a passable cave entrance (extent unknown) which is known to drip with water.\nBe sure look up to admire the scenery, too. The village is nestled within a fantastic Karst landscape with impressive limestone bluffs towering high above it.	A charming Spanish village sits atop this natural limestone overpass.
