Medieval Village	{'outsider architecture', 'architecture', 'architectural oddities'}	270	482	The Medieval Village in Turin, placed in Valentino Park, is a faithful replica of a 15th Century Piedmontese Village.\nIt was built in 1882-84 thanks to an idea of Alfredo D’Andrade, the Portuguese and medievalist eclectic architect and restorer of many castles and abbeys in Piedmont, follower of Viollet-le-Duc and also teacher of Gino Coppedé.\nNothing was invented at all: everything was designed taking as a model the best known buildings in Piedmont and in Valle d’Aosta.\nThe complex includes a village with porticoed houses, narrow streets and lively artisan shops, many-towered houses, drawbridge and the Castle.	A fake medieval village in the middle of Turin.
