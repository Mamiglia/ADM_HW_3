MIT Museum: Arthur Ganson	{'collections', 'art', 'museums', 'automata', 'museums and collections', 'robots', 'outsider art'}	406	436	Housed in the Massachusetts Institute of Technology museum in Cambridge, Massachusetts, is a permanent collection of wondrous and playful machines from MIT’s former artist in residence, Arthur Ganson.\nSome of Ganson’s wonderful machines bounce endlessly, others oil themselves, others perform mysterious tasks without explanation. Of particular interest is the sculpture in which a tiny wishbone must, Sisyphus-like, forever drag an enormous machine around behind him.\nUpdate: The MIT Museum has closed its location on Massachusetts Avenue and is moving to a new location in Kendall Square.	Bouncing, delightful, mechanical art at the MIT Museum.
