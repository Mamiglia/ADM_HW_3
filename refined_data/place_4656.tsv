Smith Memorial Labyrinth	{'mazes', 'sacred spaces'}	119	579	Situated east of Terre Haute, Indiana in the midst of scenic Hawthorn Park is a unique memorial to a local resident.\nPatterned from the Chartres Cathedral Labyrinth located in France, this labyrinth is eighty feet in diameter and following the coiling walkway through its 34 turns towards the center is a quarter-mile trip.\nWhile the purpose of the Chartres Labyrinth and many others of the age has been lost to time, this labyrinth was constructed as a place of reflection for visitors to the park. The labyrinth was finished in 2003 in memory of Kenneth E. Smith.	Modeled after the labyrinth in Chartres Cathedral, this small-town Indiana memorial labyrinth sits half a world away.
