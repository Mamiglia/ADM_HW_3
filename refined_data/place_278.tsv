Mammoth Cave	{'ecosystems', 'caves'}	2388	2367	Over 400 miles of the Mammoth Cave’s interconnected passages have been surveyed since Native Americans first began to explore it between 2,000 and 8,000 years ago. The world’s longest cave system, Mammoth Cave is 100 miles longer than the planet’s second and third-longest cave systems.\nThe National Park offers tours for every taste. For the adventurous, there’s a tour that requires guests to crawl, slither, and scramble their way through five miles of undeveloped passages. Another allows visitors to experience the caves like a true pioneer–by candlelight. Historic tours trace the presence of humans in the cave. One option will take you to an 1840s hospital used to treat consumptive patients, while another will lead you to “Gothic Avenue,” a passage where workers have left their mark by scrawling messages on the cave’s walls and creating makeshift monuments. Beyond these unique offerings, there are also general tours that give guests the opportunity to experience the beauty and ambience of the caves while learning about their history and geology.\nAbove ground there are a total of 85 miles of trails. Seven miles of paved trails surround the visitor’s center, with the rest designated for hiking, mountain biking, and horseback riding. Stunning natural features are plentiful along the trails, including sinkholes, waterfalls, bluffs, and overlooks.	The world's longest known cave system.
