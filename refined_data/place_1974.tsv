The Black Veil also has plenty of photo-ops, and homes for many artist creators, apothecaries, and jewelers from around the globe. A beautifully grim experience for those coming to experience Salem, Massachusetts.	Like stepping into a spooky fairy-tale, this shop carries the dark ideas of artists and other makers.
