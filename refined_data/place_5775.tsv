Martini Junction	{'trains', 'small worlds and model towns', 'models'}	109	494	Martini Junction is a model train built in the Needham Town Forest. It consists of 120 feet of track, supported in places by elaborate wooden supports, a station with a human-scale table and benches, and other random miniature pieces of scenery.\nIf you are fortunate enough to visit the Junction when its creator, Jim Metcalf, is there, he is likely to unlock the remote-controlled train, run it around the tracks, and answer your questions.\nJim built Martini Junction and has maintained it for ten years, ever since he and his wife discovered the spot and started picnicking there. Jim decided it would be a nice place to have a martini, hence the name.\nWhether it was before or after a few martinis that Jim decided their picnic spot in the middle of the forest would be a nice place for a scale model train, is less clear.\nRegardless, for any visitor lucky enough to find Jim running his train, the Junction is true a delight.\nWe explored Martini Junction on Obscura Day - March 20th, 2010.
