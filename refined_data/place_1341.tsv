Laurel Hill Cemetery	{'memento mori', 'catacombs and crypts'}	812	1207	One of America’s earliest Rural Garden Cemeteries, Laurel Hill serves the city of Philadelphia as one city’s most historic burial grounds.\nOpened in 1836, the cemetery hugs the banks of the Schuylkill River in what is now Northern Philadelphia. It is a sculpture garden, park, and a Historic National Landmark that covers 78 acres.\nMany Philadelphians, short on space to grow plants, will enroll in a program to take care of a dead individual’s plot, using historically accurate plants that were commonly used in the Victorian era.\nTens of thousands of graves hold statesmen, civil war veterans (both union and confederate), local celebrities, and even the fictional grave of Rocky Balboa’s wife, Adrian Balboa. A comprehensive audio tour is available via your mobile phone.	This Philly cemetery is the eternal home of many famous area residents, including Rocky Balboa's wife.
