Jiuzhaigou Valley	{'water', 'nature', 'martian landscapes', 'natural wonders', 'ecosystems'}	64	441	In just 35 years, the remote Jiuzhaigou Valley has undergone some serious changes.\nIn the 1970s, the breathtaking landscape had little permanent population and was being extensively logged. While today, the vibrant valley is fighting to keep its beauty under the weight of 7,000 visitors per day.\nNestled next to the border with the Tibetan Himalayas, the nine-village valley is a colorful natural world, comprised of turquoise lakes, cascading waterfalls and a backdrop of multi-colored and forested mountain slopes. In the highlands of Eastern China, the protected area spans a wide range of elevations from 6,500 to 14,500 feet above sea level, causing the rushing water to flow between the placid lakes.\nThis incredible landscape was formed over thousands of years by earthquakes and carbonate rocks. Jiuzhaigouâ€™s waters are especially clear from the presence of calcium carbonate, which allows visitors the opportunity to peer into the depths of the greens and blues, which reveal yet another natural phenomena: floating and underwater forests.	Snow-capped peaks, colorful waterfalls and stunning vistas on the edge of the Himalayas.
