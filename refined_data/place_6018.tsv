Kilmogue Portal Tomb	{'monuments', 'catacombs and crypts', 'megalithic', 'ruins'}	64	476	At 18 feet tall, the Kilmogue Portal Tomb is an impressive feat of megalithic stone construction.\nThe Kilmogue tomb – also called the Harristown Dolmen or Leac An Scail – is the tallest dolmen (a single-chamber tomb usually surrounded by three standing stones) in Ireland. Most dolmens were built around 3000 BC, and despite their being widely accepted to be burial sites there is little concrete evidence to identify them as actual tombs. Whatever the site’s true purpose, the Kilmogue tomb’s massive standing stones remain as a site that inspires awe in most visitors.	Huge standing stones mark a site of megalithic mystery.
