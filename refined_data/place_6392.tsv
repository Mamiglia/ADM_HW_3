Appalachian Trail Museum	{'museums and collections', 'collections', 'museums'}	138	453	Located in the middle of the Appalachian Trail, this small museum celebrates the hundreds of thousands of hikers who have done the trail either in full or in part.\nThe museum, run largely by volunteers, has over 13,000 photos of hikers who have come through the area and have a reconstruction of a shelter built by Earl Shaffer, the first person to walk the entire trail in 1948, and a kind of hikerâ€™s patron saint.\nThe museum is across from the Pine Grove Furnace General Store where hikers often take part in the tradition of eating a half gallon of ice cream in a single sitting. Many then experience the less fun part of the tradition of throwing all that ice cream up up, as their bodies - starved of fat and sugar for weeks - attempt to process the massive dose.	A museum dedicated to the history & joys of the trail & your best chance to see hikers throwing up ice cream.	['Amelia S.
