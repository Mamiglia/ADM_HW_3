International UFO Museum and Research Center	{'collections', 'strange science', 'museums', 'aliens', 'hoaxes'}	1600	2041	Prior to the opening of the International UFO Museum and Research Center in Roswell, New Mexico in 1992, the city did not really show any signs of being home to the famous “incident.” After being sought after by various UFO researchers, Lt. Walter Haut (who worked for the military in Roswell in 1947) had the idea of building the museum as an educational center for the public. Little did he know, hundreds of thousands of people from around the world were waiting for this paranormal mecca. Today, curious tourists and researchers have helped the city grow as a popular attraction, leaving the city with no other choice than to accept the reputation as epicenter of extraterrestrials.\nThe educational enterprise does not try to convince its visitors, but rather urges them to ask questions and do research in their research center. The museum features tons of information regarding the “Roswell Incident” as well as alleged crop circles and abductions. Models of aliens, UFOs, “autopsy” reports and documentaries can be found here, depicting what some believe to be the ultimate truth.\nWhether you are a believer or a non-believer, the museum is an interesting site and has allowed the once unknown town of Roswell to grow into a world known site and location for vast of amount of information regarding a handful of alleged happenings. Across the street, one can find the world’s first UFO-themed restaurant.	A museum dedicated to the alleged Roswell Incident.
