Elberton Ghost Town	{'history', 'ghost towns', 'fires', 'cemeteries', 'abandoned'}	84	739	On the Palouse, a unique landscape of pastoral rolling hills stretching across the border of Washington and Idaho, a small town was formed in 1886 by Sylvester Wait and named after his son, Elbert. Elberton soon began to flourish, boasting a flour mill, post office, black smile shop, general stores, grain warehouse, and a church.\nBy 1900, the population reached 400. Unfortunately, a fire hit the town in 1908 followed by a flood two years later, which would be the catalyst to the decline in population. Today, there are only about 15 residents within the vicinity of Elberton. Landmarks that remain include the United Brethren Church, an abandoned railroad trestle, an old overgrown cemetery, several abandoned homes and cars, and an old obstacle course that may still be in use for private parties.	A nearly abandoned 19th-century town on the Palouse.
