Inside of Sweet Willy, chainsaw artists Dennis J. Sullivan and his wife, Frances Conklin, have built a single room, complete with bathroom and loft, for visitors passing through the area.\nSurrounded by other sculptures of animals such as bears, fish, and moose crafted by Sullivan and Conklin, Dog Bark Park is also a roadside attraction for those not looking to spend the night. Visitors can arrange group tours or visit the dog-inspired gift shop and artists’ studio.\nSullivan and Conklin have been carving for decades, after getting their big break on QVC television. After appearing on the program in 1995, they did nothing but carve wooden dogs for 18 months and invested all of their profits in building Dog Bark Park, where they specialize in folk-art style wooden canine carvings. Over the years, they’ve created more than 60 different breeds and poses of dogs, working most often from photos supplied by customers.	Sweet Willy, at 30 feet tall, is the world's biggest beagle.
