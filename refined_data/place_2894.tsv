Galleta Meadows Estate	{'monuments', 'art outside', 'prehistoric', 'sculptures', 'dinosaurs', 'desert art', 'animals', 'sculpture gardens', 'dinosaur parks'}	467	791	Driving along the remote SoCA S-3 highway, you might spy a horse as it rears off to the side of the road. Then, rising out of the flat desert landscape, an elephant appears. Alarmingly close by, a T-Rex bears its maw chasing a saber-tooth tiger.\nThis is not a mirage, but the work of artist/welder Ricardo Breceda, whose sculptures dot the Anza-Borrego Desert two hours east of San Diego. Dennis Avery, the now-deceased land owner of Galleta Meadows Estates in Borrego Springs (and heir to the Avery labels fortune), envisioned the idea of adding ‘free-standing art’ to his property with original steel welded sculptures created by ‘Perris Jurassic Park’ owner/artist/welder Ricardo Breceda based in Perris, California.\nSprinkled throughout the small town of Borrego Springs are over 130 meticulously crafted metal sculptures. Elephants, raptors, mammoths, sloths, and saber-toothed tigers prowl the desert off Borrego Springs Road north and south of the town proper. From ground-hugging desert tortoises to rearing horses, each rust-colored sculpture is filled with intricate detail—from the curling eyelashes of 10-foot high elephants to the shaved metal fur of the equally imposing sloths.\nIn 2019, the Under the Sun Foundation took over management of the Galleta Meadows Estate site, including Breceda’s sculptures.\nAs large as these sculptures are, they can be tricky to find. The Under the Sun Foundation website has a helpful online map. Elephants, sloths, camels, and raptors roam the roads north off Borrego Springs Road toward Henderson Canyon Road. South of Borrego Springs, Borrego Springs Road becomes S-3 as it slides toward Ocotillo Wells. Wild horses and raptors border the highway here before Yaqui Pass Road.	Along a California highway is a kind of Jurassic Park made of metal.
