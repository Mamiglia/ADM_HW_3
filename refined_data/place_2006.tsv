Columcille Megalith Park	{'rocks', 'standing stones', 'parks', 'geology'}	362	976	While most park planners try to avoid boulders and large rocks, at the Columcille Megalith Park they are the main attraction.\nBased on the Scottish isle of Iona and its ancient Celtic stones, the park has been arranged with rings, rows, and structures made of huge standing rocks. Park founder Bill Cohea visited Iona later in life and was transformed by the gorgeous, ancient setting, feeling that it held a peaceful, possibly healing quality. Upon returning to the States, he decided to recreate that aura by erecting stones of his own. Beginning with a six-sided stone chapel, the park’s founders began constructing the landscapes in 1978. The park now features over 90 stone settings with such epic names as Thor’s Gate and Glen of the Temple. The operators of the park claim that the stones hold some sort of healing power although if this is true, the rocks are keeping that fact to themselves.\n	This park contains a number of standing stones meant to heal and inspire.
