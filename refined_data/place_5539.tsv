Justizcafe	{'Unique Restaurants & Bars', 'rooftops', 'government', 'restaurants', 'architecture'}	138	510	Breeze through the metal detectors, open up your bag for a quick search, and stop to admire the main hall before heading to the elevator. Once you arrive at Justizcafe—tucked on the roof of Vienna’s Palace of Justice—you’ll be served lunch surrounded by lawyers, judges, and a 360-degree view of Vienna’s city center.\nThis gem of a workplace eatery exists primarily for those taking a break from court, but it’s also quietly accessible to the general public. From the German Renaissance–style palace’s outdoor terrace, well-informed travelers can bask in unrestricted views of Vienna’s historic Ring Road, Austrian Parliament, the Hofburg Imperial Palace, and St. Stephen’s Cathedral.\nMeals are surprisingly affordable (8 to 12 euros), but food is no afterthought. Chef Ivo Brnjic, who has cooked for celebrities such as Prince Charles, helms the kitchen. Diners are offered a choice of three rotating menu options made with simple, fresh ingredients. After an epicurean lunch with spectacular views, the Palace of Justice’s rich history and stunning architecture might just seem like a bonus.
