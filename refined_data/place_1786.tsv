Florissant Fossil Beds National Monument	{'bug week', 'nature', 'geology', 'geological oddities', 'natural wonders'}	600	1039	A national monument in Teller County, Colorado, the Florissant Fossil Beds are known for, well, the Florissant fossil beds. Fossilized stumps of a redwood forest litter the site, which is the most prolific source of fossilized insects anywhere in the world.\nLocated in a mountain valley and operated by the National Park Service, Florissant Fossil is a popular tourist destination because of its exhaustive record of a particular kind of prehistoric life.\nThe visitors center is filled with fossilized insects on display, complete with background and scientific information. A 14-minute film shown in the center is recommended. It explains that the fossils are contained in the Florissant Formation of Eocene age. Almost 35 million years ago, volcanic eruptions buried the lush valley that was once in this area. Ash petrified the redwood trees — some up to 14 feet wide — that grew here and a lake formed that became a resting place for thousands of plants and insects.\nThe Florissant Fossil Beds were set aside as part of the National Park System in 1969. The hiking trails are another popular reason for visiting the park; they wind several miles past wonderful outcrops of weathered Pikes Peak granite.	The largest source of fossilized insects anywhere.
