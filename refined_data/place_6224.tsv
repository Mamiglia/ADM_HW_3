Honghe Hani Rice Terraces	{'plants', 'cultures and civilizations', 'unesco', 'landscapes', 'horticulture', 'ancient'}	33	463	The stunning Honghe Hani Rice Terraces cover 1,000,000 acres from the slopes of the Ailao Mountains down to the Hong Kong River in Yunnan, China.\nThe 1,200-year-old elaborate red rice terraces were created to bring water down from the forests to allow for farming on the slopes. The system of terraces stretches over four counties — Yuanyang, Honghe, Jinpin, and Lvchun — although the main area is in Yuanyang.\nIncorporated into the terraces are 82 villages, and a farming system involving buffaloes and cattle, as well as eels, ducks, and fish.\nThe terraces were designated an UNESCO World Heritage Site in 2013.	A complex and beautiful system of rice terraces covers a million acres over the mountains.
