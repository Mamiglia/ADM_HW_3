Convento de San Francisco Ossuary	{'ossuaries', 'catacombs and crypts', 'relics and reliquaries'}	561	787	Beneath the church at the Franciscan Monastery in Lima, Peru, there is an ossuary where the skulls and bones of an estimated 70,000 people are decoratively arranged.\nLong forgotten, the catacombs were rediscovered in 1943 and are believed to be connected via subterranean passageways to the cathedral and other local churches. Both creepy and beautiful, they feature small grates scattered along the upper floor of the cathedral through which, while you are touring, you may look down at any given moment to see the artistically arranged dead illuminated.	The mortal remains of an estimated 70,000 people lie in the basement of a monastery in Lima, Peru.
