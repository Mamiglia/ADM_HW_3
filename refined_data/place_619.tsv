Devil's Hole Ruins	{'ruins', 'mystery'}	140	1717	These beautiful ruins near Devil’s Hole Creek deep in the Pennsylvania woods are thought to have been a ski lodge or a speakeasy, but to this day, no one really knows what previously stood at this now crumbling site.\nThe mysterious ruins are located on Pennsylvania State Gamelands # 221 in Paradise Valley just outside the town of Cresco. There is much to explore, but the highlight is the very large double fireplaces that obviously warmed multiple floors of the former structure. There is also what appears to be a wood or coal furnace and what looks like a water boiler.\nWhile it looks like the original structure was built and remodeled in different decades—there are remnants of stone, concrete and cinder blocks—it’s possible that it was all built at the same time as all these materials were available during the 1920s and 30s. Some locals believe the ruins was originally a speakeasy from the Prohibition era.\nWhatever it was, it’s suspected that the building met its demise in the mid-1950s, either by a large fire or possibly a flood. One of the local legends is that there was a bottomless lake in the area and anyone who swam in it sank and went to Hell—hence the name “Devil’s Hole.” The lake is said to have disappeared after the large flood that hit the area in 1955.\nYou can see more exploration of the ruins in this video.\nUpdate July 2018: The road to the parking lot is closed and not accessible to many vehicles.\n	These beautiful ruins deep in the Pennsylvania woods are thought to have been a ski lodge or a speakeasy, but no one really knows.
