There are also several trees that have survived the blast and continue to thrive.\nThe site of the hypocenter itself is marked only by a plaque showing a photo of the devastation which resulted and stating the bare facts. Visitors leave flowers and paper cranes in memory of the dead.\nThe plaque can be found less than five minutes’ walk from the A-Dome.	A plaque marks the site directly below the mid-air detonation of the atomic bomb over Hiroshima.
