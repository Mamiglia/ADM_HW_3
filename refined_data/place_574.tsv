Hole n the Rock	{'eccentric homes', 'roadside attractions', 'homes', 'taxidermy'}	774	1773	Travelers along U.S. Highway 191 in Southeastern Utah are amazed to discover this unique, 5,000 square foot home carved directly into a rock.\nAlbert Christensen began construction of his rock home in the 1940s, digging, carving, and blasting for 12 years before moving his family in and opening a unique diner for desert passersby. Though Albert died in the late 50s, his wife Gladys continued to live in the rock and run the diner for many years. She died in the 70s, and both she and her husband are buried on the grounds of the rock they called home.\nToday the whimsically punctuated Hole n” the Rock is a successful roadside attraction, running tours of the home Christensen built with passion and drive so many years ago.\nInside, 14 rooms are arranged around huge pillars, with shelving carved right out of the walls. Among the attractions are a fireplace with a 65-foot chimney drilled through solid sandstone, a deep french fryer, and a bathtub built into the rock.\nThough no human lives in the Hole n” the Rock today, it is still inhabited by the charming Harry, a taxidermied pet donkey. He is in poor repair, but it is apparent that he was well-loved and was mounted with care by his former owner, Albert.\nOutside the living quarters, you’ll find a rock and cactus garden, a petting zoo, plus picnic tables and benches carved from stone.
