'Twisted House'	{'art outside', 'woodwork', 'sculptures'}	210	746	This topsy-turvy house looks like it’s being supported by its own roof. The sculpture, called “Twisted House,” was created by John McNaughton, an artist whose work has been featured in Smithsonian collections and the White House.\nFor over 35 years, McNaughton taught woodworking at the University of Southern Indiana. He created this piece in 2015, and it showcases his crafty woodworking skills. The house is crafted from cedar wood while the five windows contain glass. Even the flowers on the windowsill are made out of wood.\nWhat makes this sculpture unique is that visitors can actually walk into the artwork as if it were an actual house. Visitors can peer out the window and view the surrounding woods. The forest’s dirt makes up the house’s floor. This piece is a stunning example of bringing together nature and art.\nThis whimsical sculpture can be viewed for free at the Indianapolis Art Center. The art piece is kept outside and is best viewed in warmer weather.
