Rubulad	{'Unique Restaurants & Bars', 'shops'}	154	875	Hippies or hedonism? Either way, the themed get togethers thrown by this Brooklyn fixture should be experienced at least once. Get ready to abuse some substances and dance the night away amongst DJs, puppeteers, and contortionists.\nThe eclectic Alice in Wonderland-esque decorations at the warehouse location almost pale beside the eccentric and wildly dressed crowd. Bonus points if you consider body paint a legitimate substitute for clothing!	Check out the underground party scene at the Burning Man of Brooklyn.
