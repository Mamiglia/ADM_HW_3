A short 15-minute drive outside of Memphis into north Mississippi puts you in the serene woods and rolling hills of Desoto County, where this large nursery complex is nestled.\nBrussel’s Bonsai is the United States’ largest bonsai nursery. It boasts a state-of-the-art facility with over 175,000 square feet of greenhouse space nestled just outside of Memphis devoted to raising and showcasing these incredible miniature trees. The nursery is the brainchild of Brussel Martin who, after gaining an interest in bonsais as a child, opened the store in 1975.\nRows of greenhouses hold everything from common indoor and outdoor bonsai to a showroom full of some of the most unique, breathtaking bonsai trees in the world (check those price tags!). Walking through the showroom is like entering a forest of meticulously manicured trees.\nBrowsing its expansive collection is completely free. If you want to purchase your own starter kit, the nursery has a small shop and welcome center at the front of the property.	Walk through row upon row of manicured miniature trees at the United States' largest bonsai nursery.
