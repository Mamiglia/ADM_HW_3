Jökulsárlón	{'natural wonders', 'nature', 'water'}	1533	1626	Despite the splendor of Jökulsárlón’s light blue and milky-white icebergs, the beauty of the glacial pool in southeastern Iceland is bittersweet.\nAs the melting of nearby glaciers has accelerated, the landscape grows both increasingly stunning and fragile. Since the 1970s, the melting glaciers have grown the Jökulsárlón lagoon to be four times larger, now measuring at 11.1 square kilometers wide.\nFormed entirely from glacial melt, Jökulsárlón is situated directly next to Iceland’s largest glacier, Vatnajökull, which covers eight percent of the country. As chunks of ice break off Vatnajökull, they float atop the icy blue waters of this whimsical glacial lagoon.\nScientists estimate that the continued rate of melting of Vatnajökull will cause a massive fjord to exist where the glacier once stood, again adding to the natural beauty of Iceland’s landscape, but doing so at a great environmental expense.\nA visit to Jökulsárlón has become a must for Iceland bound travelers keen on seeing the lagoon that has become popularized in such films as “A View to a Kill,” “Die Another Day,” “Tomb Raider,” and “Batman Begins.”\nFor those keen on seeing the Aurora Borealis, Jökulsárlón is a fantastic place to watch the Northern Lights. Photographers will often come and set-up their tripods before sunset.	Iceland's largest lagoon is home to stunning multi-colored icebergs.
