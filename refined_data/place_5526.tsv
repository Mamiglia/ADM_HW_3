Orava Castle	{'film locations', 'medieval', 'vampires', 'castles'}	143	511	Orava Castle is an eerie and majestic place, built high up on a rocky cliff over the winding Orava river. It is one of the most beautiful and well-preserved medieval castles in Slovakia, dating back to the 13th century.\nIts long history starts as a military barracks built after a Mongol invasion to defend what was then the Kingdom of Hungary. Seven centuries later it still stands, now an elaborate neo-Gothic castle that holds many unique myths and legends.\nNotably, the striking exterior was used as the filming location for Count Orlok’s Transylvanian castle in the 1922 silent film Nosferatu, a claim to fame that adds to its haunting appeal.\nInside, a tour of the castle museum takes visitors through the knights’ room, paintings gallery, weapons room, and a collection of many scientific and archaeological artifacts.	The 700-year-old fortress was the site of Count Orlok's castle in Nosferatu.
