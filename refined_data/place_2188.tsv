Warm Springs Pools	{'hot springs', 'native americans', 'preservation', 'water'}	170	930	When it was built in 1761, Warm Springs Pools was a “gentlemen’s” bathhouse, uniquely built in an octagonal shape with a large hole in the roof to let the steam out. The women’s bathhouse next door came several decades later in the same fashion. Today, the original structures still stand, beautiful yet in a sad state of advanced decay.\nThe bathhouses were built over the year-round 98-degree natural pools in the aptly named Warm Springs, Virginia. The waters flow at a rate of 1,700,000 gallons per day.\nThese magnificent crystal springs were discovered centuries ago by Native Americans journeying through the valley. Archaeological evidence suggests that humans have been in the area for at least 9,000 years. According to Native American stories, people were instantly rejuvenated after bathing in the warm waters of the spring, and it was considered a sacred place.\nSoon after, spa houses began being built throughout the 16th century following the European style. These spa houses become even more popular in the following century in places where wealthy southerners would “take the waters” for relaxation.\nBut it was the healing promises of the mineral-rich waters that brought Thomas Jefferson to the pools, where he soaked daily for three weeks to try and help his rheumatism. It’s ironic that the pools were named after him, though, as local historians claimed he found the spa quite boring.\nBoring or not, the Warm Springs Pools are still flowing today. The original wood structure of the bathhouses has fallen victim to the elements for over the last 250 years, however, and the physical surroundings are in quite obvious decline. But an organization is working to preserve this rotting wonder, so guests can bathe in the warm springs just as Thomas Jefferson did decades ago.\nUpdate: As of December 2021, The Jefferson Pools are temporarily closed for restoration. The Omni Homestead Resort and the Virginia Department of Historic Resources are working to repair and renovate the pools while maintaining their historic character.	Bubbling up from deep underground is the warm crystal clear water that fills the Warm Springs Pools, America's oldest spa.	['Thorny Mountain Fire Tower', 'Humpback Bridge', 'Pearl S.
