Rush Ghost Town	{'mines', 'ghost towns'}	180	990	While zinc mining in Arkansas has dried up, its history lives on in the ghost town of Rush, the only standing remnants of an industry that once dominated the area.\nRush is a ghost town located in The Buffalo River National River Park. Prospectors originally came to the area for what were thought to be silver deposits, which were discovered to be zinc. It was soon one of the most prosperous cities in the state and during World War I, Rush was the center of the mining industry in Arkansas. At the end of the war, as zinc prices declined so did Rush. Mines closed, the population began to disappear. In 1972 Rush was officially declared a ghost town and became part of the Buffalo National River Park system.\nUnlike other mining cities in the area Rush still has original buildings, mines and other structures all of which are cared for by the park service. There is a trail that will take you to the more remote areas of the town, and mines. Please bear in mind that the mines have been abandoned and are dangerous. The park service does not allow entry to the mines themselves.	The final remnant of the Arkansas zinc industry is this historically protected ghost town.
