It includes such vintage carnival items as wooden carousels, fair stalls, German swings, and a Hooghuys Organ. Best of all, you can play a carnival game and even ride on some of the rides, such as the “Manège vélocipédique” from 1897, a carousel of bicycles powered by the pedaling of its riders.\nThe museum is open only by reservation or by attending one of the scheduled seasonal tours.	A museum of carnival attractions where you are invited to ride the rides.
