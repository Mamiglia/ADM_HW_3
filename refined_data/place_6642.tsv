Valle Planes of Fame Air Museum	{'collections', 'airplanes', 'transportation', 'museums', 'airplane graveyard', 'aviation', 'museums and collections'}	78	439	Old aircraft sit outside this small museum, forming an intriguing airplane graveyard. Step inside the museum, and you’ll find even more planes and aviation memorabilia that may have otherwise been lost forever.\nPlanes of Fames Museum was born from the passion of Ed Maloney’s desire to “preserve, inspire, educate, and honor” the aviation industry. Maloney started the first museum in 1957 with 10 planes. The original location was moved to Chino, California and this second, smaller location is in Valle, Arizona.\nBut just because it’s smaller than the original museum doesn’t mean it’s any less impressive. Visit this museum, and you’ll discover an impressive collection of beautifully restored vintage planes. The collection, which continues to grow, includes cars and other war artifacts as well. There are hands-on exhibits within the museum and the airplane boneyard is available to walk through outside for a close up-look at the antiquated equipment.\nMany planes have been restored to flying condition and are on display and in the sky annually for an aviation show. In addition to the museum, you’ll also find a well-stocked aviation-themed gift shop.\nUpdate as of December 2021: The museum is currently closed until further notice.	An incredible airplane graveyard sits outside this small museum dedicated to preserving aviation history.
