Leroy's Place	{'art', 'puppets', 'shops'}	96	919	Walking into Leroy’s Place is like teleporting into a Tim Burton movie (one of the old ones), but with giant monster puppets everywhere. The window, a casual beach scene with a monster building a “sandwich castle,” is sure to catch your eye.\nThe exterior is just a hint of what the shop holds. Leroy’s Place is a whimsical wonderland filled with original art, film, puppetry, clothing, and gifts. It feels like more of a lighthearted gallery than a store. It’s just the type of random and magical place you hope to find when exploring New York.\nOnce inside, you can enter through a secret door to get inside an installation with a giant “tiger sharktopus” puppet,  make a monster play guitar, and receive slobbery kisses from a “Ralf.” You can browse—and buy—one-of-a-kind artwork featuring all sorts of marvelous monsters. The collection of gifts available for purchase is handmade, pun-filled, and hilarious. Leroy’s Place even has a secret courtyard where they host events and workshops.	This interactive gallery makes you feel like you've stepped into a fantasy world filled with whimsical monsters.
