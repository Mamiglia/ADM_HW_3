Knightridge Space Observatory	{'abandoned', 'observatories', 'abandoned observatories'}	248	1125	Update: The observatory was torn down in 2020. Only brick rubble remains.\nBuried in the Indiana wilderness, the abandoned Knightridge Space Observatory is astronomy’s answer to the eerie backwoods shack.\nA simple, two-story telescope dome, the observatory was built between 1936 and 1937 in the then-remote area of Bloomington. The squat building consists of just two rooms, one on the ground floor and an upper room where the crude, four-ton telescope could look out of the retractable viewing slot built into the domed ceiling. While the outer wall is made of sturdy brick, the interior construction and the dome were built from wood. The dome was placed on a track with rollers that allowed the entire ceiling to rotate in order to find the best viewing angles. The facility was simple, but effective for early 20th-century astronomers.\nThe area of Bloomington continued to grow over the years and eventually grew close enough to the station that the observatory’s delicate viewing instruments were no longer as effective. This, combined with a growing obsolescence, led to the observatory’s eventual abandonment.\nWhile it has been emptied of its equipment, the Knightridge Space Observatory still stands. The viewing window has been damaged by falling logs, the dome has rusted in place, and the upper floors are treacherous with rotten wood, but the ruin still manages to draw the interest of explorers.\nThe telescope was removed in the mid-1960s and is now located at the NJAA Observatory in Voorhees State Park, New Jersey. It is still operational and open to the public on select Saturdays during the summer.	If astronomy had a ghost, it would look like this observatory.
