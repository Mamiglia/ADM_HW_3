Schilthorn Piz Gloria	{'Unique Restaurants & Bars'}	225	476	Nestled atop the Schilthorn rests the revolving Piz Gloria restaurant, offering unbeatable views of the Bernese Alps in Switzerland.\nWhile Piz Gloria claims to be the world’s first revolving restaurant—a dubious title given that the Seattle Space Needle opened in 1962 during the World’s Fair—its real claim to fame is its James Bond connection and unparalleled views.\nPiz Gloria is named after the 1963 James Bond novel and subsequent film, On Her Majesty’s Secret Service, in which a mountain-top hideout conceals Bond’s nemesis, Ernst Stavro Blofeld. Today, Piz Gloria taps into its James Bond past by offering visitors a 007 Walk of Fame and interactive exhibit aptly named Bond World.\nThe restaurant, which is truly the main draw for travelers, rotates slowly offering diners a view of 200 mountain peaks during the course of their meal. While the food of Piz Gloria has been reviewed as lackluster and overpriced—a classic pitfall of many tourist attraction restaurants—the view overcompensates for what’s on the plate.	A cablecar-station-turned-revolving restaurant with 360-degree views of the Swiss skyline.
