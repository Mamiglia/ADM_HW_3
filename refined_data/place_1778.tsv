Mineral Wells Fossil Park	{'geology', 'paleontology', 'fossils', 'rocks', 'parks'}	185	1042	At first, Mineral Wells Fossil Park seems to be only a large pit of rocks. Dig a bit deeper, and you’ll find the park contains a fossil formation from an ancient seabed. Each handful of gravel is full of fossils more than 300 million years old.\nA myriad of ancient fossils from the Pennsylvanian Period awaits those willing to get their hands a bit dirty. You can expect to find paleontological treasures from creatures like corals, urchins, clams, oysters, trilobites, sharks, and miscellaneous plants. The most common fossil species is crinoids (sea lilies), also often called “Indian beads” or “Indian buttons” in reference to their button or bead-like shape.\nRoughly eight acres, the park was formerly part of a gravel pit at the old landfill. Eventually, wind and rain unearthed its feature fossil formation. Now, it’s one of the few parks in the nation where you can remove artifacts from the site and take fossils home with you.\nThe park is a haven for paleontologists and fossil collectors. It’s open to everyone and admission is free.	This former Texas landfill is flush with 300 million-year-old fossils, all fit for the taking.
