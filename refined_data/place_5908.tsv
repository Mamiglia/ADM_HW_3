Fire-Breathing Dragon Bridge	{'architectural oddities', 'statues', 'dragons', 'fires', 'bridges', 'architecture'}	354	483	This 1,864-foot-long bridge has a steel dragon that breathes fire.\nOpened on March 29, 2013, the bridge commemorates the 38th anniversary of the taking of the port city of Da Nang by the North Vietnamese near the end of the Vietnam War. The metallic dragon was modeled on one from the Ly Dynasty and is illuminated with 2,500 LED lights.\nWatching it shoot fire might seem a bit terrifying for the six lanes of traffic that drive beneath the mythical giant, but it can also playfully spray water from its mouth.\n	This bridge is embedded with a giant steel dragon that breathes fire from its mouth.
