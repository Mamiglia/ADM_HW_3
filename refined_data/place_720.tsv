Kilt Rock and Mealt Falls	{'nature', 'geology', 'cliffs', 'geological oddities', 'natural wonders', 'music', 'optical oddities'}	785	1608	On the Inner Hebridean Isle of Skye are two spectacular sights, both visible from the same observation point on the Trotternish Peninsula.\nOne of these is the magnificent 90 meter Kilt Rock, which looks strikingly similar to a pleated kilt. Made up of basalt columns resting on a sandstone base, one might even say that the colors of the rock formation appear almost tartan.\nThe other point of interest is the Mealt waterfall, which, fed from nearby Mealt Loch, plummets from the top of the cliffs to the rock-laden coast below.\nBeyond these visual treats there is also an aural element to the site. When a strong wind is blowing while one observes the sights, a beautiful yet haunting tone appears to come from the surrounding area. Disguised, the instrument emitting the eerie noise is actually the fencing that surrounds the lookout point. Holes facing the sea allow wind in to the piping, turning the safety feature into an organ of sorts to accompany the breathtaking views off the north-eastern coast of Skye.\nOn clear days, the Isle of Lewis and even mainland Scotland can be seen from the Trotternish Peninsula. About 17 km north of Portree, up Staffin Road, and just 2 km shy of Staffin, the observation point can be found.	Ancient cliffs resembling a kilt on Scotland's second largest island emit an entrancing sound.
