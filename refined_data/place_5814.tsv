Insectarium of Montreal	{'museums and collections', 'animals', 'natural history'}	572	491	Founded by Georges Brossard, an enthusiast entomologist, the Insectarium of Montreal displays both live and dead insect collections, and has over 160,000 specimens.\nThe Insectarium has its own anthill, honeybee hive, and bumblebee hive, all of which can be observed from a safe distance for the squeamish, and it’s said that from a bird’s eye view, the building itself is very “buggy” in shape and design.\nIf you are lucky and adventurous. you may even taste some of the specimens – the museum has been known to hold “Insect Tastings,” delving into a culinary angle that many cultures are already quite comfortable with: the preparation and consumption of protein-rich crickets, stick bugs, and beetle larvae.\nUpdate: This will be closed until 2021.	The biggest museum dedicated to insects in North America, one of the largest in the world.
