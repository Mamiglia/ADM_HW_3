Antelope Canyon	{'geological oddities', 'nature', 'geology', 'natural wonders'}	1222	4842	Frequently subject to flash floods, Antelope Canyon can only be visited through guided tours because of the extreme danger. Still, it has managed to become the most photographed and most-visited slot canyon in all of the American Southwest due to its beauty and a peculiar phenomenon of natural light beams.\nFormed by millions of years of wind and water erosion, Antelope Canyon’s magnificent smooth and flowing shaped sandstone has made it one of the most famous slot canyons in the world.\nLocated within the LeChee Chapter of the Navajo Nation in Arizona, Antelope Canyon is actually two separate canyons, the upper canyon and lower canyon. The upper canyon, which the Navajo call Tsé bighánílíní (“the place where water runs through rocks”), is a narrow passage through 120-foot-high canyon walls. The lower canyon is known as Hazdistazí (“spiral rock arches”) and is a shallower V-shaped canyon that is a more difficult trek for visitors.\n	Most-visited and most-photographed slot canyon in the American Southwest.
