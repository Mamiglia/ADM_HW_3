The current collection contains around 2.5 million books.\nVisitors can visit many special collections in addition to the main halls, which include prints, maps, papyri, portraits, music, and theater. But the magnificent library itself is the focal point here. Among the exhibitions are two exquisite Venetian baroque globes — one for the Earth and one for the sky, each with a diameter of more than one meter.\nKeep your eye out for library employees slipping through concealed passages hidden behind certain bookcases.	The beautiful baroque library of the Hapsburg empire.
