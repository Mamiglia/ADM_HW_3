Indiana Medical History Museum	{'medical museums', 'anatomical theaters'}	344	1300	The Indiana Medical History Museum is in the old pathology building of the Central State Hospital for the Insane.\nPart of what makes the Indiana Medical History Museum so fascinating is that this research and education facility is a time capsule from the late 19th and early 20th century. The building itself is the oldest surviving pathology facility in the nation and is on the National Register of Historic Places. Make sure to see the 1896 teaching amphitheater, where visiting medical students and doctors viewed autopsies.\nTours are guided only in the museum, but you can see the medicinal garden during the spring and summer.Â  This is one of the most fascinating and odd museums in Midwest America and if you live in the area you should not miss an opportunity to visit.	A medical facility that has been kept frozen in time.
