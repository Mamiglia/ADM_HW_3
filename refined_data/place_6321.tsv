Castillo Torre Salvana	{'medieval', 'ruins', 'sacred spaces', 'castles', 'architecture', 'churches', 'abandoned'}	39	456	This once-grand castle is over 1,000 years old, but now sits dilapidated, abandoned, and open for people to explore.\nCastillo Torre Salvana dates back to the 10th century. It can be found just outside of the city of Barcelona and is little-known by most people, even many locals who live in the city.\nThe fortress-like castle is located next to the historic Colonia Güell, a purpose-built village for the workers of a nearby textile mill. The castle was partially destroyed in the Catalan Civil War in 1224. It has sat abandoned for centuries.\nThese days the ruins serve as a place where you can explore and capture some great photos. Many of the walls inside the castle have been eroded over time, but there are still distinct hallways and rooms to discover.\nThe second floor is intact and offers a great view over the surrounding former factory village of Colonia Güell. The village’s church was designed by the famous architect Antoni Gaudi and, like Castillo Torre Salvana, is not very well known. The church can be seen from the castle’s second-floor windows, so you can experience two of Barcelona’s hidden gems at the same time.	The abandoned ruins of a beautiful medieval castle just outside Barcelona.
