Wolf Mountain Nature Center	{'nature preserves', 'animals', 'wolves', 'conservation'}	35	494	Situated on 60 acres of land in the hills of New York state, this nonprofit conservation center is home to 24 total animals, including 14 grey wolves (including timber wolves, Alaskan tundra wolves, and other breeds), six pure arctic foxes, and four eastern coyotes.\nThe center offers visitors a chance to see these beautiful creatures in what is as close to their natural environment as possible. The animals are spread over a series of large enclosures (the largest is over nine acres), so the animals can avoid being seen by the public if they want to. That said, they have all been raised by humans and are almost always out by the fence happy to see who is visiting them.\nThe center also holds several events throughout the year, such as “wolves and watermelons” and a chance to go inside with the arctic foxes in winter to take pictures.\nThe center is run by volunteers, and all money raised goes toward caring for the animals. Wolf mountain is also part of a larger nationwide breeding program and sometimes will trade puppies with other facilities, most recently with Wolf Park in Indiana.
