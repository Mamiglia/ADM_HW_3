Pomander Walk	{'intriguing environs', 'ecosystems'}	459	1337	New York architecture is rarely characterized as whimsy, but consider the gated Pomander Walk an exception. Modeled after the set for the London play called Pomander Walk, this neighborhood anomaly sits incongruously amongst the surrounding high rise buildings of the Upper West Side. But thatâ€™s all part of its pastel-colored charm.\nJust ask Humphrey Bogart or Woody Allen, both of whom owned property in the neighborhood. Sadly, most of us will have to take their word for it since the community is private and kept gated at all times. So just take a glimpse and wistfully imagine the rest for yourself.	Peek through the gates at this oasis from the city, full of Old English charm.
