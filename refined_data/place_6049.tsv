Ukrainian National Chernobyl Museum	{'disasters', 'disaster areas', 'museums', 'museums and collections', 'nuclear'}	252	474	This small and unassuming museum documents the catastrophic nuclear incident that occurred at Chernobyl on April 26, 1986, at 01:23, Moscow  time. The museum’s slogan is “est dolendi modus, non est timendi,” Latin for “there is a limit of sadness, anxiety has no limits.”\nOutside the museum stands a tank, an ambulance, a fire jeep, and a military jeep. The entrance is a staircase lined with street signs which name every village affected by the disaster.\nChernobyl had a population of 49,346 people living in 11,000 apartments, and as such evacuation was not immediate. The radiation on April 27, 1986, the day of the evacuation, was 400 - 1500 mR/h. This exceeds the acceptable norm 75,000 times.\nThe small museum includes three exhibit halls that seek to inform, remind and issue a stark warning of the reconciliation that is necessary between man, science, and the technology that threatens and endangers the Earth.	This unassuming museum's slogan translates to “there is a limit of sadness, anxiety has no limits.
