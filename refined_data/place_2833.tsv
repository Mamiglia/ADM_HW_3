Church of Sant Miquel del Fai	{'architectural oddities', 'water', 'sacred spaces', 'cliffs', 'religion', 'waterfalls', 'monasteries', 'architecture'}	44	805	Chiseled out of the cliffside in Cataluña, Spain, this gorgeous monastery overlooks a plunging vista complete with a waterfall that runs straight through the architecture.\nAncient monasteries are often beautiful, whether still working or lying in ruin. But the church at Sant Miguel del Fai is otherworldly in its setting. Masterfully carved out of solid rock on the face of a cliff, this nearly hidden place of worship has one of the best views in Spain.\nAs a rushing waterfall tumbles hundreds of feet into the emerald pool below, it’s hard not to imagine visiting (or living in) this place and easily attaining the peace and tranquility perpetually sought by the most devout religious groups and monks.	An enchanting monastery in the Spanish countryside appears lifted from a fantasy tale.
