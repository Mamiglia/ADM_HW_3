Gljúfrafoss	{'waterfalls', 'hidden', 'water'}	846	2018	Waterfalls can make for some of the most magical vistas in the world as they carve solid rock into often incredible formations.\nSuch is the case with Iceland’s Gljúfrafoss waterfall, which is almost completely hidden behind a cliff face. The waterfall has carved a mossy cylindrical chamber into the rock which can only be reached through a thin crack in the outside cliff wall.\nOnce through the crack, explorers are hit with the incredible majesty of the hidden waterfall as it crashes into a pool at the base of the cave. The interior of the cave is nearly completely covered in a thin carpet of greenery thanks to the continually moist surroundings. These clandestine waterworks distill the natural wonder of Iceland’s scenic beauty.	This fantastical waterfall is hidden in a cave located in a cracked cliff.
