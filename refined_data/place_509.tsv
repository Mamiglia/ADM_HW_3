Trans-Allegheny Lunatic Asylum	{'ruins', 'abandoned insane asylums', 'architecture', 'architectural oddities'}	516	1883	The Trans-Allegheny Lunatic Asylum, which changed names over the years and was known as the Weston State Hospital later in life—operated from 1864 to 1994.\nToday it stands as a testimony to the inhumane practices once used in mental health. Sitting on 26.5 acres, this spooky area is home to numerous buildings, including a museum, a gift shop where a few of the remaining employees still work, and an abandoned cemetery.\nFamous for its looming structure, it was built using the Kirkbride design, a design common to asylums of the early 19th century. Much of the asylum remains closed off to the general public as the main building and out-buildings are in bad repair and are structurally unsound. A wide choice of tours are available, and specialty supernatural/ghost hunts, even overnighters are available for those searching for tortured spirits who have yet to escape.	A particularly creepy abandoned hospital that sparks interest for lovers of the supernatural.
