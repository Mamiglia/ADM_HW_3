Gatorland	{'ruins', 'abandoned amusement parks', 'theme parks'}	447	818	Once a varied collection of South Florida reptiles, Gatorland has since become a property gutted and abandoned. It’s certainly among the hidden gems of South Florida, where many unused buildings are quickly demolished and repurposed as condos or storefronts.\nBecause of its location, Gatorland doesn’t seem to be in any danger of disappearing anytime soon. It is a symbol of the vast emptiness you find when leaving the big cities and exploring the sparsely populated areas of Florida.\nNote: Not to be confused with the still-operating Gatorland located at 14501 S. Orange Blossom Trail, Orlando, FL 32837\nUpdate as of November 2019: A large amount of foliage now covers the buildings and the site may be difficult to see.\nUpdate as of September 2022: Unfortunately, the site has been razed. A new power substation is present and additional construction is underway.	One of many gator theme parks, abandoned in the sugar fields of South Florida.
