Enchanted Forest	{'ruins', 'ghost towns', 'abandoned amusement parks', 'amusement parks', 'abandoned'}	237	1073	Most people wouldn’t call the fanciful narratives they once believed in as a child “abandoned,” but for those who do consider them such, this deserted, but privately owned amusement park is the perfect metaphor.\nLocated in a small Rhode Island town, you’ll see the big blue sign off main street with Humpty Dumpty sitting on it, overgrown by weeds, from the road.\nThe adventurous will find fairly easy access (easier than most operating theme parks anyway) due to gaps that have developed in the park’s fences. As of 2009, most of the buildings still stand, and tons of equipment and ruins of attractions still populate the grounds, complete with a go-kart track, bumper cars, and a giant wooden pirate ship.\nPlease note… this location is not abandoned, as suggested. It is privately owned, and trespassers will be prosecuted.\nUpdate: As of Summer 2015, Enchanted Forest has been sold to a private party. They plan to restore what has been neglected and live on the premises.\nUpdate: As of January 2017, much of the property is still wooded and undeveloped. The only remnants of the park are the parking lot, the overgrown miniature golf course, the bumper car course and two structures.\nUpdated as of July 2021: The property marked as “Sold” and newly erected gate at entry with No Trespassing signage.	This fairy tale-themed amusement park is now abandoned, and childhood metaphors abound.
