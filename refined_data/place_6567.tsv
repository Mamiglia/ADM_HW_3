The Raven's Nest	{'art', 'sculpture gardens', 'sculptures', 'outsider art'}	105	441	Like a raven, Icelandic director Hrafn Gunnlaugsson has collected shiny things and discarded scrap metal on his oceanside property in Reykjavik, creating a makeshift sculpture garden. The garden and home are consistently evolving and incorporate new finds, such as a rusted-out buoy eyeball and rebar cross, into the surreal landscape.	This oceanside Reykjavik spot is speckled with recycled sculptures and large stones.
