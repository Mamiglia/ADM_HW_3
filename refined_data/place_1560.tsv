Tomnadashan Mine	{'film locations', 'abandoned mines', 'intriguing environs', 'caves', 'comedy', 'mines', 'ecosystems', 'abandoned'}	93	1122	There’s much more than dust and bits of metal hidden within the depths of this mine. If you’ve ever seen Monty Python and the Holy Grail, you know it’s home to things far more sinister.\nFinding this mine is must for all Monty Python fans. They’ll immediately recognize it as the spot where King Arthur and his “brave” knights confront the cute but killer bunny that guards the Cave of Caerbannog, which is home to the Black Beast of Arrrghhh.\nIn the non-Monty Python World, the Cave of Caerbannog is really the abandoned Tomnadashan Mine. The mine was built in the 19th century, but attempts to glean copper, gold, and sulphur from its depths proved unsuccessful.\nThe abandoned mine is a quiet place—so don’t worry if you’ve forgotten to pack your Holy Hand Grenade of Antioch. It’s also a fairly elusive spot. In fact, it’s so well-hidden that when Michael Palin and Terry Jones, two of the film’s stars, attempted to find the mine as part of celebrations for the film’s 25th anniversary, they couldn’t remember where it was located.	Monty Python fans will recognize this abandoned mine as the Cave of the Killer Rabbit of Caerbannog.
