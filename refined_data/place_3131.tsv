Pensacola Futuro House	{'homes', 'architecture', 'houses'}	459	758	This Futuro House, dubbed the “UFO House” on Google Earth, has withstood many hurricanes since it was erected in the 1960s—which is appropriate since the portable space age structure was originally conceived as a ski cabin.\nThe experimental design was soon hyped as the home of the future, but only less than 100 were ever built, and around 60 still remain scattered across the globe. This Futuro now houses the Pensacola Beach Preservation and Historical Society Headquarters.	Pensacola's UFO home has withstood many hurricanes—just as the experimental 1960s design intended.
