Collins Beach UFO Boat	{'ufos', 'beaches', 'hidden'}	219	1127	This abandoned, graffitied, fang-shaped boat on a Portland nude beach is the perfect destination for those seeking an unusual hiking destination, or a taste of the extraterrestrial. It’s empty and out of commission—just there—a blank canvas for your imagination.\nIt may seem inhospitable, but the boat actually housed a family for three months in 1973. Conditions weren’t quite as dismal as you might assume, based on the boat’s current appearance. The boat featured a working, if minimalist, kitchen, and electric lighting powered by a generator. But life wasn’t exactly comfortable, with one resident recalling waking up lopsided, with the boat half-raised on land thanks to overnight tidal shifts.\nToday, the boat is most notable for its eclectic graffiti and, well, for just being its pretty random self. Intriguing as it is, you’re best off staying outside. Years of neglect or, perhaps, clandestine alien invasions, have caused the floor to be covered in shattered glass.\n	This abandoned boat sits on a nude beach, is shaped like a UFO, and is covered in graffiti.
