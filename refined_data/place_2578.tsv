Mooresville's Gravity Hill	{'optical illusions', 'gravity hill', 'optical oddities'}	208	843	It’s best to be careful when driving along country roads—particularly if those roads are in Mooresville, Indiana. One could encounter any number of creatures or farm equipment on a typical country lane, but in Mooresville, you’re also likely to encounter basketballs, cars parked in neutral and maybe even a few curious pedestrians holding bags of flour—all at the bottom of one captivating hill which seems to be pulling everything upward, against gravity.\nMooresville’s famous Gravity Hill (near Magnetic Acres) is an optical illusion, but it is a convincing one. If one were to put their car in neutral at the “bottom” of the hill (or place a ball in the road, for the safety-conscious), the hill will immediately start to pull it “up” - in the wrong direction, according to our old friend gravity.\nLegend has it that a school bus stalled at the bottom of this hill decades ago when it intersected with a railroad track, then was struck by an oncoming train, killing several riders. Nowadays, the locals will tell you that it’s the spirits of the children on that bus that push things uphill and out of harm’s way. They’ll even instruct you to sprinkle some flour on your bumper - in which the children’s fingerprints supposedly appear after you’ve been pushed to safety.	This mysterious hill seems to pull objects uphill.
