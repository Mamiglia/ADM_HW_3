St. Anthony's Chapel	{'relics and reliquaries', 'nature', 'relics', 'natural wonders', 'museums and collections', 'rites and rituals'}	281	1113	St. Anthony’s chapel, set in a small neighborhood overlooking Pittsburgh, PA, houses the largest collection of religious relics in the world outside the Vatican.\nFather Mollinger, an immigrant from Belgium, left the world of medicine to serve his faith. When he learned of mass amounts of relics without homes in Europe, he personally collected them with his own funds. When there were too many in his home to continue living alongside them, he built the chapel and housed the relics there.\nFather Mollinger was known for his healing abilities. When he arrived in Pittsburgh there were no doctors and so he began helping people with their ailments. He built an apothecary alongside the church, and started making medicines for people. He believed that the medicines combined with spiritual guidance such as instructions on doing certain prayers or not eating meat on Fridays (as Catholics of the time did not) led to miraculous healings like those done in Jesus’s time and indeed the pile of left over canes, crutches and other evidence from those experiencing cures seems to support this belief.\nAfter his death, Mollinger’s medicines continued to be sold for use in mainstream pharmacy.\n	This church in Pittsburgh is home to the largest collection of religious relics in North America.
