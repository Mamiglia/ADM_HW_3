Elvis Karate Fight Plaque	{'plaques', 'music', 'elvis', 'rock and roll'}	194	553	Elvis once broke up a street fight in Madison, Wisconsin.\nOn June 24, 1977, Elvis Presley, while riding to Madison from the airport, noticed a street fight in progress at what was then a Skyland service station. While his limo was stopped at the nearby red light, the King ran from the car and threatened the combatants with a classic karate stance.\nThe young men recognized Elvis and stopped fighting in favor of shaking hands with the star. Elvis reportedly left after ensuring that everything was settled and taking time to shake hands with several onlookers. Elvis died 52 days later. The incident was reported by Thomas Still for The State Journal, who called it Presley’s biggest brawl since Jailhouse Rock.\nA plaque to commemorate the event is installed where the gas station once stood. It shows Elvis with a guitar and in a pseudo-karate stance and describes the incident.\nUpdate: As of July 2019 the description of the incident is no longer there, but the plaque and Karate Elvis remains.	A stone marker memorializes the spot where the King broke up a street fight with a classic karate stance.	["'Crowning Woman'", 'Royal Thai Pavilion', 'Lamp House']	3618 E.
