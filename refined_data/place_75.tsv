Fremont Troll	{'cryptozoology', 'follies and grottoes'}	5148	3675	An 18-ft. tall troll, made of concrete, clutches an old VW car where it sits underneath the George Washington Memorial Bridge in Seattle, Washington. The car is an actual Volkswagen Beetle encased in concrete, which used to be red and bear a California license plate.\nThe Troll was constructed in 1990 after winning a Fremont Arts Council competition for designs to improve the freeway underpass, which then was a dumping ground. He was sculpted by Steve Badanes, along with two of his University of Washington architecture students, Will Martin and Ross Whitehead, and Steve’s then-girlfriend Donna Walter.\nThe troll has had a rough go of it, and is often getting spray painted. One incident involved giving the troll green fingernails, tattoos, fangs, and a green eye.\nThe paint can’t be easily removed from the troll and to cover it a fresh layer of concrete is added every time, so the troll has been growing blobby concrete lumps. While painting it is poor form, climbing on it is encouraged.\nOctober 31 is recognized as the Fremont Troll’s birthday. Known as Troll-o-Ween, it includes a celebration and stage performances open to the public.	A giant Troll lurks under one of Seattle's oldest bridges.
