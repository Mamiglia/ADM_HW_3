No Name Lake	{'water', 'nature', 'hidden', 'lakes', 'natural wonders', 'mountains'}	92	920	With so much to see and do in Oregon, it’s still amazing to find a location that few people know about. No Name Lake is such a place.\nThe colorful lake is nestled within a stretch of mountains. When the snow melts on Broken Top Mountain and its surrounding peaks, the water pools to form this picture-perfect natural wonder.\nDuring the spring to summer months, when the lake is not frozen, it exudes a beautiful turquoise color that sparkles in the sunlight and makes it stick out from the rest of the landscape. Moreover, even during the peak of summer, you’ll be able to catch a glimpse of the snow and ice perched at the summit of Broken Top.\nThe lake’s striking color isn’t the only reason to trek to this spot. Here, you’ll also be greeted with spectacular views of the steep valleys and mountains Oregon has to offer, as well as its lush and dense forests.\nAdditional bonuses are the fact that dogs are allowed (though your canine hiking partners must be leashed). You can also camp along the shore of the lake—as long as you clean up after yourself and leave no trace of your presence—ensuring you’ll spend the night surrounded by nature’s beauty.	Unknown to many, this sparkling turquoise lake hides amid Oregon's snowcapped mountains.
