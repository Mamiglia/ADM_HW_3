The Toy and Action Figure Museum	{'museums and collections', 'toys', 'museums'}	213	890	Located in the quiet town of Paul’s Valley, Oklahoma, The Toy and Action Figure Museum celebrates the bright, wild world of action figures with a cacophonous collection of plastic characters.\nThe museum is partitioned into different sections, including a collection of cartoon artwork from famous Oklahoma illustrators, and a room known as the “Batcave” that features nothing but Batman-related figures and collectables. The museum holds over 13,000 distinct action figures, many of which have never been taken out of their packages.\nThe main attraction of the museum is the sprawling central diorama, which features thousands of figures from every imaginable franchise. Spider-Man swings past a hanging X-Wing fighter while Psycho Man makes an entrance onto a Peewee’s Playhouse playset. The effect is one of childish joy.\nNearly five years before the museum’s 2005 opening, Paul’s Valley started an initiative called Vision 2010, the goal of which was to create attractions that would drive local tourism. To this end, local toy designer Kevin Stark began working on The Toy and Action Figure Museum that stands today. Stark was able to open the museum as a fully accredited nonprofit, the only official museum of its kind in the world.\nIn addition to all of the toys on permanent display at the museum, visitors can pick up some action figures of their own at the site’s gift shop, or should we say, toy store.	The world's only museum devoted solely to the art and collection of action figures.	['Chickasaw National Recreation Area', 'Julian P.
