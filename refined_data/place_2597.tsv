The Shameful Tiki Room	{'Unique Restaurants & Bars', 'tiki', 'bars', 'shops', 'kitsch'}	270	839	An escape to a Polynesian paradise in the middle of Vancouver.\nThe owners of the Shameful Tiki Room do their very best to recreate the tropical escapism of the 1960s tiki fad, and they succeed. Their emphasis is on over-the-top South Seas decor, quiet exotica lounge music to set the mood, and of course, authentically sugary tiki cocktails like the Zombie, the Hurricane, and the Mai Tai.\nThe walls are adorned floor to ceiling - a hallmark of any good tiki joint - with Polynesian decor of varying authenticity. There are pufferfish lamps, Tapa cloths imported from Tonga and Fiji, and tiki carvings both old and new. The Shameful Tiki Room also features live music that is always appropriately tropical - mostly surf rock and gentle ukulele music. A second location has opened in Toronto, so Eastern Canadians donâ€™t have to miss out on the fun.	A high point in Vancouver kitsch.
