Victoria's Last Resort	{'shops', 'places to stay'}	40	507	This B&B is like stepping into your own special art piece. The carpets are leopard, the fireplaces are mosaics inside, and the guest suite has a crazy mosaic shower that is a must-see to believe. The place is quirky and completely private. That’s right, just one guest at a time.\nVictoria’s Last Resort’s Royal Treatment will spoil you for any other option. Not a traditional bed and breakfast, this is a bed and brunch and your brunch is always served when you are ready. You also get a four-course dinner fireside and plenty of special treats all tailored to your likes. Every detail is thought of … even the soaps are made by Victoria.\nAn ideal location for honeymoons and romantic getaways, Cambria is a small village with galleries, restaurants, and shops. A nearby wine region is a favorite destination for visitors and nature lovers will enjoy numerous hiking trails.\nUpdate as of February 2020: The inn is closed and the restaurant is now known as Mezzo Italiano.	Cambria's most unique B&B features creative surroundings and fantastic food.
