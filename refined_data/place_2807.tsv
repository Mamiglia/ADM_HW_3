Tri-State Peak	{'geographic markers', 'nature'}	257	808	This isn’t a particularly large or scenic mountain, but it’s noteworthy for geography nerds. The hike gets its name from being the point where Kentucky, Tennessee, and Virginia all meet. Located in the Cumberland Gap National Historical Park, this is also the start of the 300+ mile Cumberland Mountain Trail that Daniel Boone and other settlers took.	Kentucky, Tennessee, and Virginia meet at this point in the Cumberland Gap.
