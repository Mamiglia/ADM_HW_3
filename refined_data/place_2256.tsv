New York architects Schultze & Weaver created a luxury palace that combined many popular revival styles of the day including Mediterranean, Renaissance, and Beaux Arts. The firm would later go on to design the Waldorf-Astoria Hotel.\nThe Biltmore Hotel was the birthplace of the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences in 1927 and the site of eight Academy Award ceremonies between 1931 and 1942. In 1960 it was the host of the Democratic National Convention that chose John F. Kennedy as the presidential nominee.\nThe hotel has been a featured location on numerous TV productions including Mad Men, Glee, The West Wing and Charlie’s Angels. It has also appeared in numerous films including Chinatown, Beverly Hills Cop, Spider-Man and Independence Day. Its exterior also appeared in Ghostbusters as the Sedgwick Hotel in which Egon (Harold Ramis) deliverers the immortal line, “Don’t cross the streams.”	This opulent hotel has been visited by Spider-Man, Charlie's Angels, and the Ghostbusters.
