Love Locks of East London	{'collections', 'love locks'}	378	677	In the English summer of 2012 padlocks began appearing on a wire fence opposite a train station in East London.\nThe fence, which encircles the vacant Bishopsgate Goods Yard in the hip Shoreditch locale, is arguably a non-permanent structure, but the padlocks accumulating on it are intended as the exact opposite. Known as “love locks,” they are symbols of everlasting love.\nSweethearts inscribe their names or initials on a padlock and attach it to a fence (or other public fixture) as a memento of their unbreakable bond. In addition to an increasing collection of locks, the Shoreditch fence also features colored wool and twine woven around the diamond-shaped mesh in the shape of hearts.\nIt is ironic that diagonally opposite the site is a locksmith, but it’s unknown if scorned lovers have ever demanded his services.	Lovers proclaim their unbreakable bond by leaving their names on locks fastened onto the Shoreditch fence in East London.
