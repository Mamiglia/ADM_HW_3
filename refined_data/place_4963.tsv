Gorilla Building	{'pop culture', 'architecture', 'statues'}	126	555	While King Kong is synonymous for perching high atop the Empire State Building in New York City holding Ann Darrow in his hand like a rag doll, it appears there is a copycat giant gorilla on the loose in Japan.\nDangling off the top of a three-story commercial building in the Sangenjaya neighborhood of Tokyo is a giant gorilla. Though not officially identified as King Kong, the gorilla is acting in a similar manner as the larger-than-life creature of the iconic monster film released in 1933, having scaled the building while possessing something in its hand.\nThe Sangenjaya gorilla presents a schoolgirl in his right hand as he extends his arm down from the top of the pink commercial building that houses a FamilyMart convenience store on the ground floor. A girl with black hair in pigtails is wearing a green dress, but no shoes—most likely having fallen off during the ascension of the building. She appears to be in good spirits; more confused than frightened.\nUnsurprisingly, this out-of-the-ordinary scene is affectionately and appropriately known as the “Gorilla Building.” It is less than a 10-minute walk from the Sangenjaya train station.	A King Kong-like gorilla hangs from the top of this commercial building in Tokyo.
