'Treatment Rooms' Mosaic House	{'art', 'mosaics', 'homes', 'houses', 'murals'}	121	959	In a quiet corner of West London, on an unassuming residential street, you will find a wondrous house that is a beautiful work of art.\nThe house, known as the Treatment Rooms, is owned and lived in by a renowned mosaic artist, Carrie Reichardt. With the help of other mosaic artists from around the world, it took several years to complete, finally completed in 2017.\nThe house is covered both front and back with intricate mosaics illustrating issues close to the artist’s heart. There are quotes from Martin Luther King, and images addressing the plight of inmates on death row and other social injustices. The artwork is reminiscent of the revolutionary murals painted by the famous Mexican mural artists.\nThe back wall is almost exclusively taken up by a huge white octopus, and on top of the wall are small pyramids detailing phases of the Moon. It is a remarkable and vibrant work of art, and well worth the journey from Central London. After viewing the front of the house, don’t forget to walk around to the back of the house in Cunnington Street.	This home on a quiet suburban street is completely covered with vibrant mosaics.
