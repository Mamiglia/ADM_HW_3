Abandoned Dome House	{'retrofuturistic', 'abandoned houses', 'homes', 'houses', 'architecture', 'abandoned'}	106	578	An uninhabited dome house in poor condition deteriorates in the woods of North Carolina.\nThe house shares a certain architectural aspect with Futuro Houses, a 1960s architectural fad, prefabricated vacation homes that were appropriate for beaches, mountainsides, and forests. They were the invention of Finnish architect Matti Suuronen, and sold like hotcakes when they debuted in 1968. They represented a leisurely, modern vision of the future. The trend didn’t last though, and today more Futuro Houses lie abandoned than inhabited.\nWhile this particular home appears more Futuro inspired than an actual Futuro model, it has nonetheless suffered the same fate of abandonment.\nThe dome house in the woods outside Chapel Hill is in very bad shape. The roof is caved in and severely rotted decking prevents any real access. But you can still see the strange white bubble shape along the south side of Jack Bennett Road and peek your head in through the hatch to imagine the life of Futurians.\nUpdate 2017: Sadly, this home was destroyed and removed by a developer on April 7, 2017.
