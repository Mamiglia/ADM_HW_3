Seven Magic Mountains	{'monuments', 'sculptures', 'art', 'nevada', 'installations', 'geology', 'geological oddities', 'rocks'}	969	1644	Most people visit Las Vegas for casinos and crazy night clubs, but drive 10 miles beyond the Sin City walls and you’ll come face to face with one of Nevada’s most unique and unknown sights, the Seven Magic Mountains.\nBuilt as a public art exhibit by Swiss artist Ugo Rondinone, the 30-foot fluorescent “totems” stand like brightly colored beacons lighting up the desert sky. Rondinone used locally sourced boulders, and chose this location because it’s “physically and symbolically mid-way between the natural and the artificial.”\nVisitors can walk right up to the stacked boulders, as well as read interpretive signage and use cell phones to listen to an audio tour.\nUpdate as of July 2019: Though the Seven Magic Mountains were intended to be taken down in 2018, the Bureau of Land Management issued a three-year permit for the display to remain through the end of 2021.	Brightly colored 30-foot-tall totems light up the desert sky just outside Las Vegas.
