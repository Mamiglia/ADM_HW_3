Stonehenge II	{'stonehenge', 'statues'}	422	1317	In a field alongside this small country road stands a replica of Stonehenge.\nThis 60% scale replica is built by, and on the farmland of, the late Alfred Shepperd, along with the help of his friend and neighbor Doug Hill. It represents what Stonehenge might have looked like before weather and erosion toppled some of the original in Salisbury, England. Two years after Stonehenge II was built, a pair of Easter Island moai figures were added to the site.\nOne major difference between Stonehenge and Stonehenge II is weight. While the stones at Stonehenge weigh over 4 tons, the ones that compose Stonehenge II (with the exception of two stones in the center) are made of plaster applied to a wire mesh frame and are considerably lighter.\nUpdate: The Stonehenge II structure along with the moai heads has since been moved from the field on Texas Highway 1340 near Hunt, Texas to its current location in front of the Point Theater and Hill Country Arts Foundation on Highway 39 in Ingram, Texas.	A recreated Stonehenge stands in a country field, complete with Easter Island moai heads standing as sentries.
