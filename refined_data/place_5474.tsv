Barberville Yard Art Emporium	{'naive art', 'antiques'}	189	514	Situated just off of State Road 40, this little wonder is certainly off the beaten trail, but it’s well worth the stop. Behind the statues that line the front of the property is a large assortment of decorations, statues, furniture, figurines, and all kinds of other wonderfully handcrafted ornaments from all over the world. Items of every color and variety sit, waiting for a good owner with the right eye. Manatee mailboxes, teak tables, crucifixes, boiled peanuts, various different honeys, colorful reflectors, hematite rings, and dinosaur statues are just a few of the creative works displayed at this artists’ paradise.	This kitschy curio wonderland is full of fake animals, teak tables, and a cacophony of random bric-a-brac.
