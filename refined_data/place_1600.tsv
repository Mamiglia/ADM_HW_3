The Tower Ravens	{'history', 'towers', 'animals', 'birds', 'legends'}	2739	1108	Superstition rules the ravens’ roost at the Tower of London, where it has long been believed that if the ravens ever leave the edifice, the Crown and all of Britain will fall.\nThe myth is believed to date back to the 17th century, when King Charles II declared that ravens must be permanently kept at the tower. Ever since, at least six black birds have been kept captive at the tower to prevent any potential downfall of the country. However, the folkloric beliefs surrounding the birds are probably much older, with some evidence suggesting that it may ultimately derive from elements of Celtic mythology in which the raven was imbued with power including of a talismanic and protective nature.\nThe tower avians also please the thousands of tourists who visit the historic landmark daily. Don’t feel sorry for the birds, however; they are well-fed and receive better care than just about any other birds in England. The feathered guardians of Britain eat 170 grams of raw meat a day and are fed blood-soaked biscuits as a treat.\nThe birds’ wings are clipped, but they have plenty of food, water, and tower green to move about on as they perform their crucial duty. Their open cages are next to the Wakefield Tower, along with historical information plaques and signs about these winged protectors of Britain.	Six ravens are kept captive (but well-fed) at the Tower of London to prevent the fall of the Crown.
