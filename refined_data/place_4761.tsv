Glitter Mountain	{'intriguing environs', 'geology', 'geological oddities', 'mountains', 'mines', 'ecosystems'}	75	570	This “mountain” glitters in the sun, thanks to the small crystals that freckle its slopes. The mountain is actually an old selenite mine. It’s still deeded to the mine owners, though it’s managed by the Bureau of Land Management.  It has a brief history and synopsis of selenite and its uses.\nIt’s possible to wander among the small selenite deposits sparkling along the edges of the small pit. It’s a fun and interesting little adventure site suitable for the whole family.	This old selenite mine is dotted with tiny crystals that make it shimmer like it's covered in glitter.
