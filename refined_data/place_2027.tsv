Its permanent collection housed a research library of over 2,000 ebooks as well as artifacts such as memorial artworks, medical moulages, wax embryological models, natural history specimens, and a variety of uncanny artworks and artifacts from around the world.\nIts popular and often sold-out lecture series features academics, artists, collectors, morticians, rogue scholars and autodidacts speaking on topics such as wax anatomical models, bejeweled skeletons, and books bound in human skin. In addition, the Morbid Anatomy Museum held workshops in topics such as anthropomorphic mouse taxidermy, Victorian mourning jewelry, and insect shadowboxes.\nUpdate December 2016: The Morbid Anatomy Museum recently announced its closing.	A museum devoted to bringing to light forgotten or neglected histories through exhibitions, education and public programming.
