Starkenberger Beer Pools	{'alcohol', 'places to stay'}	22	655	For beer lovers this is one of only a few places in the world where they can truly, literally, immerse themselves in beer. At the Austrian brewer Starkenberger’s Castle they offer a complete beer-centered experience with beer trivia, beer history, and of course, beer drinking.\nHowever, the most unique elements of the castle are the “world’s only beer-swimming-pools” — seven 13-foot pools of warm beer (with some water), each containing some 42,000 pints where one can sit and bathe and relax fully immersed in beer. The beer is rich in vitamins and calcium, and it is said that sitting in it is good for the skin and helps cure open wounds and psoriasis.\nThe pools started back in 2005 when the old fermentation cellar of the 700-year-old castle became obsolete, so they turned the area into a beer spa. The beer is kept quite hot, although you can order a cold beer from the pool.\nDrinking from the pool is ill-advised.	Where beer lovers can literally immerse themselves in beer.
