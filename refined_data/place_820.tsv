Lost Gardens of Heligan	{'plants', 'outsider art', 'horticulture'}	443	1511	On a palatial estate in Cornwall, a massive and unique garden has been restored to its original beauty after 75 years of languishing unloved.\nSince the late 1500s, The Lost Gardens of Heligan belonged to the Tremayne estate evolving and becoming more extravagant with each passing generation. One head of the household inspired the jungle gardens, while another requested that giant rhododendrons be cultivated.\nThroughout the 19th century, the gardens thrived, growing larger and requiring greater staff to manage them. Before the outbreak of World War I, the Tremayne estate employed 22 gardeners. Many of those loyal gardeners went to fight, and after the war, their numbers had diminished so that the gardens fell into severe disrepair. As the rest of the estate was rented out, the gardens became an afterthought and were not rediscovered until the 1990s.\nTheir rediscovery by a distant relative of the Tremayne estate led to a widely publicized attempt to bring the gardens back to life. The restoration of the Heligan Gardens was undertaken by Tim Smit, the same architect who conceived The Eden Project, the largest Greenhouse complex in the world.\nUnder his innovative and watchful eye, the Heligan Gardens were restored to their original size. Besides restoration, floral art was commissioned as well, resulting in the Giantâ€™s Head and the Mud Maid, a sleeping woman of the forest made out of wood, grass, and earth. As the gardens quickly became a tourist attraction, the gardens also served to bring life back to St. Austell, and some of the other neighboring towns in Cornwall.\nToday, the spectacular gardens feature everything that they were once renowned for including massive rhododendrons, Italian gardens, and the jungle gardens. Along with being beautiful, they are also productive, growing large amounts of vegetables for consumption and sale.\n	400-year-old garden, restored to beauty.
