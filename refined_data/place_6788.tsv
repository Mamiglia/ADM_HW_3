The Pony Express National Historic Trail and Museum	{'natural wonders', 'nature', 'postal'}	297	431	A 1,400 mile trail begins at this historic Pony Express Museum in Missouri.\nThe Pony Express service was founded by William H. Russell, Alexander Majors, and William B. Waddell in 1849. It was a mail service, delivering messages all the way from St. Joseph, Missouri to Sacramento, California by horseback.\nIt became the fastest and most direct form of communication in the country at the time.\nThe national historic trails follow the original routes very closely beginning with the original stable in St. Joseph, Missouri (now a museum). Every year 1,966 miles are travelled by the National Pony Express Association as a sign of recognition and historical value.\nThere usually are over 500 riders that participate in the event, and it lasts for 10 days. But year round, visitors are invited to see historic sites or travel along the trail by hiking, horseback or automobile. The trail provides a chance to explore of one of the oldest and unique trails in the world.	The fastest mail service in the west is tracked and memorialized along this 1,400 mile trail.
