Geyser Spring Trail	{'geysers', 'nature', 'trails', 'water'}	116	1256	This geyser won’t shoot high in the air like Old Faithful, but that doesn’t make it any less impressive. It may not put on much of a show, but the geyser is still worth seeking out nonetheless.\nAccording to the United States Forest Service, it’s the only true geyser in Colorado. If you hang around for a while, you’ll likely see it erupt—meaning you’ll start to see it roil over the sides of the pool and spill a little into the creek.\nBecause it’s secluded within the mountains of the San Juan National Forest, you won’t have to worry about fighting through the crowds that flock to other more famous geysers, and you are likely to have it all to yourself. As such, hiking to this watery gem feels like stumbling upon a secret, safely guarded within the woods.\nA newly constructed bridge will take you across the river to an easy trail through the woods (2.5 miles, 500 feet of elevation gain), slowly climbing up the hillside amid the smell of sulfur from hidden vents scattered in the woods. But don’t worry: it’s not an overwhelming stink.\nYou’ll descend down a small hill and see a sign marking the geyser, if the bright turquoise waters don’t give it away first. Don’t hang around too long or soak in it, as the hydrogen sulfide the gurgling water emits is toxic.	Colorado's only true geyser is hidden within the San Juan National Forest.
