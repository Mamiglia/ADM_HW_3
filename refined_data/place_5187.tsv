Treehouse at Kīlauea	{'treehouses', 'eccentric homes', 'homes', 'places to stay'}	51	537	The Kīlauea Treehouse offers those clever enough to make a reservation in advance the chance to live out the childhood fantasy of sleeping in a treehouse. Not to mention this treehouse is high in the canopy of a tropical Hawaiian forest.\nBuilt out of a recycled church, the treehouse is mid-canopy in the forest, just two miles from Kīlauea, an active shield volcano. Luckily the trade winds carry the fumes and ash in the other direction so your stay won’t be tainted with volcanic spewing.\nBesides the novelty of sleeping in a tropical treehouse, the site offers a perfect chance to see the volcano up close. You can even go after dark and see the glow of the molten lava while the volcano caldera boils at night like an enormous cauldron.	A true treehouse near Hawai'i Volcanoes National Park.
