Palouse Falls	{'nature', 'state parks', 'waterfalls', 'water'}	451	1558	Unless they know what they’re looking for, hikers are unlikely to simply stumble upon the near-hidden Palouse Falls.\nRushing out of the side of a cliff almost 200-feet from the pool below, the Palouse River was once a contender for the tallest waterfall run in the world. While it did not earn this distinction, the site is a uniquely beautiful location and is protected as a state park. The falls make for a fantastical photo opportunity, just be sure you don’t lose yourself in the park’s beauty or hikers won’t be likely to find you either.	An obscure waterfall that looks like something out of a fantasy novel.
