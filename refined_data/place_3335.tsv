The other has been set aside for use by graffiti and street artists, and is constantly updated with fantastic, colorful paintings both large and small.\nA favorite stop for photographers with its ever-changing landscape, the walkway has shown work from nationally known artists Shepard Fairey and Enzo & Nio, and it’s not uncommon to find local artists at work when you visit.
