Feral Cat Colonies of Hollywood Forever Cemetery	{'graveyards', 'cats', 'animals', 'cemeteries'}	489	1175	Visitors come to Hollywood Forever Cemetery to see the final resting places and eclectic graves of dead Hollywood stars, but in certain corners of the graveyard they’ll find attractions that are very much alive.\nThe cemetery manages five feral cat colonies. The felines can often be seen sunning themselves on the flat gravestones near the front wall. The graveyard has set out shelters, food, and water for the cats, which don’t seem at all rattled about prowling above the decaying bones buried beneath their paws.\nAlthough they congregate near the front boundary where they can easily grab a bite to eat, hide in their shelters, or run up trees to escape the cemetery, some cats do wander farther into Hollywood’s land of the dead. Observant visitors can sometimes spot the upright tail of a curious cat poking above the headstones or catch one taking a catnap near a mausoleum.\nPeacocks and peahens also strut around the cemetery. The grounds are home swans, geese, ducks, turtles, and koi, too.	Dozens of feral felines rule a segment of Hollywood's only graveyard.
