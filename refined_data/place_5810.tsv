Bazalgette the Whale	{'statues', 'hidden', 'whales', 'roadside attractions', 'animals', 'parks'}	178	491	There’s a huge gray whale lurking beneath the surface of a tiny park in Yachats, Oregon. At least, that’s what this whimsical sculpture wants you to believe.\nThe first thing visitors to Whale Park will notice is the metal whale tail sticking up from the grass. Upon closer inspection, it becomes clear the ground in front of the tail is rounded as if the rest of the graceful giant were swimming just below the surface.\nAbout once every minute, the whale announces its presence with a spray of water from a hidden source. When the sun hits it just right, it looks as if the underground whale is spouting rainbows.\nOfficially known as Bazalgette the Whale, the bronze sculpture was created by local artist Jim Adler in 1995 and is designed to resemble a life-sized gray whale.	There's something big lurking beneath the surface of this tiny Oregon park.
