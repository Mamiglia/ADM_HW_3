Santa Claus, Arizona	{'cultures and civilizations', 'santa claus', 'abandoned santa parks', 'intriguing environs', 'ghost towns', 'abandoned amusement parks', 'ecosystems', 'abandoned'}	353	1308	The Mojave desert, with its blisteringly hot summer sun, Joshua trees and bizarre rock formations, would not generally be the place one would choose to honor a man whose traditional home is the North Pole. Yet standing in the desert are the ghostly remnants of Santa Claus, Arizona. Nina Talbot and her husband arrived in nearby Kingman, Arizona, in the early 1930s.\nThe Talbots founded Santa Claus, Arizona, in 1937 as an attempt to attract buyers to the desert location. It featured several Christmas-themed buildings and visiting children could meet Santa Claus any day of the year. The town’s post office became very popular in December as children and parents could receive mail postmarked with the town’s name.\nThe town did in fact become a popular tourist destination, however, no one ever bought land there, and the only people living there were the ones working in the town. Failing to see how she would make her real estate profits, and with the town in decline, Talbot sold Santa Claus in 1949, having failed in her attempt to convince people to move to the desert.\nOne of the places in town that was genuinely successful was its local restaurant, the Santa Claus Inn (later renamed the Christmas Tree Inn). Critic Duncan Hines, who would later become famous for the brand of food products that bears his name, described it as being of the best in the region. In 1950 science fiction writer Robert Heinlein wrote a short story about a sumptuous gourmet meal served thereby Mrs. Claus. Gentlemen Prefer Blondes star Jane Russell even threw a dinner there in 1954. But even this was not enough to save the town and, by the 1970s, it had already begun to fall into disrepair.\nWhen writer Mark Winegardner visited the area in 1988 for his new book, it had become a sad shadow of its former self with “Styrofoam silver bells, strands of burned-out Christmas lights, and faded plastic likenesses of Old Saint Nick. A lopsided, artificial twenty-foot tree whistled in the wind beside a broken Coke machine and an empty ice freezer. Two of the three buildings were padlocked; through their windows, encrusted with layers of sand and decades-old aerosol snow, Jim and I saw dusty, overturned fiberglass statuettes of elves and reindeer.”\nThe last gift shops and amusements went out of business in 1995, leaving little recognizable, except for a few vandalized buildings, a wishing well, and the “Old 1225,” a derailed, pink children’s train covered with graffiti.\nAs of 2015, little remained of Santa’s Land. It’s just two boarded-up, graffitied buildings. The train is gone, and there is little that remains of the special town. Someone even stole the face of Santa off the front sign.\nIn 2021, Santa Claus was razed and the lot leveled and cleaned. The lot is for sale for close to $1 million.\n	A Saint Nicholas-themed ghost town in the Mojave desert.
