As the millennia drifted by the foundations grew into the crags which still exist today. Many of the pinnacles stand over 10 feet tall and are a popular attraction for tourists looking to set foot on alien soil without ever leaving the Earth.	Alien rock formations grown from the sands of an Australian national park.
