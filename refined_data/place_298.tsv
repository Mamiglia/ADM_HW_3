The Torture Museum	{'crime and punishment', 'collections'}	979	2317	The Torture Museum in Amsterdam reveals the dark history of a time when justice was meted out by sticks and spikes. It is composed of a few darkly lit corridors and prints displaying tortures throughout the past. These prints are explained in a variety of languages for all types of visitors.\nAside from the fitting aura of small, dark spaces and the historical prints, there are several old torture instruments. A mask and a heretic fork depict the punishment for gossipers and those accused for muttering heresy. The museum also sports the tools for the worst of criminals, including a hanging cage for those who were to be made an example of and an inquisition chair for a more interactive torment.
