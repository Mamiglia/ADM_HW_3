Lower East Side Toy Company (The Back Room)	{'Unique Restaurants & Bars'}	374	2016	Through the gate that reads “Lower East Side Toy Company” make your way along an historic path to the Back Room, a true-to-life 1920s era speakeasy.\nInside you will find a dimly lit lounge with a crowd taking their drinks from tea cups, their shots from espresso cups, and their beers from paper bags. Best of all, the Back Room, complete with a VIP room hidden behind a hinged bookcase, was an actual 1920s era speakeasy and, besides the absence of a locked door and password, it remains an excellent way to replica of the underground alcohol scene of the 1920s.
