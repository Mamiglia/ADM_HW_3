The short distance between the two allows tourists to visit both of these natural wonders in one day.\nLake Melissani was given its name after archaeological excavations in 1951 and 1962 revealed Minoan depictions of the nymph Melissanthi and the god Pan. The lake itself was created many years ago when a huge underground cavern collapsed, leaving a large circular opening to the surface. Between 11am and 1pm on sunny days, Lake Melissani is an otherworldly blue.\nThree hundred years ago, the Drogarati Cave was discovered after an earthquake opened up a previously closed entrance, but it was not until 1963 that the cave was opened to the public. Those who have been fortunate enough to visit are treated to its beautiful stalagmites and stalactites. The largest room in the cave, “Sala of Apotheosis,” is 900 meters square and illuminated. It is often used for concerts because of its outstanding acoustics.	A spectacular cave and a beguiling lake.
