Lewis, one of the 20th century’s literary greats, rest within a peaceful cemetery. Nearby, an etched glass window bearing characters from his most famous fantasy world adds a whimsical touch of childhood magic to the churchyard.\nThe grave of C.S. Lewis lies within the cemetery of the Holy Trinity Church in Headington Quarry just outside of Oxford. He was buried there in November of 1963, and even today it’s common to find flowers placed atop his tombstone.\nC.S. Lewis is best known for his beloved fiction novels, notably The Chronicles of Narnia, The Screwtape Letters, and The Space Trilogy. He is also known for his popular works of non-fiction Christian apologetics, including Mere Christianity and The Problem of Pain.\nLewis was educated at Oxford University, which is only a couple miles from the churchyard. After serving in World War I, he returned to Oxford to become a tutor and fellow in English Literature at Magdalen College. He was one of the “Inklings” that brought weekly fractions of the fantasy realm to the town’s local haunts.\nInfluenced by close friend J.R.R. Tolkien and others, Lewis returned to Anglicanism in 1930 and began attending Holy Trinity Church. The famous writer was a regular at the church’s 8:00 a.m. service, which he chose because of his dislike of organ music. In 1992, a gorgeous etched glass window featuring beloved Narnia characters was installed in the church. The fantasy scene is located adjacent to the pew where he always sat.	The beloved fantasy novelist is buried near a church containing a whimsical etched glass window full of Narnia favorites.
