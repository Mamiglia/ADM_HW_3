Christmas House	{'outsider architecture', 'santa claus', 'architecture', 'architectural oddities'}	148	407	There is much speculation as to the “real location” of Santa’s workshop, but there is a strong case for northern Iceland, 7km from the city of Akureyri. The isolated location means minimal distractions for Santa and his crew, and the weather is certainly cold enough to accommodate his reindeer.\nWhat really distinguishes this Santa’s workshop from others is its owner, who is a little too convincing as the big man in the red suit. Even upon visiting in June, one will be greeted with festive cheer. Here Santa lives in the workshop, which only adds authenticity to his claim. As you might imagine, the Christmas theme only gets stronger once inside the workshop, and although there are some items for sale, this is clearly a labour of love more than a commercial enterprise.\nThe perfect place to have a Merry Christmas, you can top off your experience by posting a letter home from Santa’s mailbox.
