West Side Market	{'food', '19th century', 'markets', 'fruit', 'meat'}	1308	1039	Kielbasa! You’ll never see so much kielbasa in your life—smoked, fresh, double-smoked, Hungarian, Polish. There’s an orgy of beautiful meat at the West Side Market: One stand is called the Pork Chop Shop.\nThere are gorgeous edibles of all kinds. The market hall is crammed end to end with 100 stalls: butchers and bakers, fishmongers and cheesemongers, spice sellers and rice sellers. Greengrocers line the arcade alongside the original building.\nCleveland’s West Side Market may be North America’s finest indoor food hall, the equal or better of Philly’s Reading Terminal Market, the Lancaster Market, and Montreal’s Jean Talon. A food market has operated at (or next to) this location since 1840, but the current building—including clock tower—went up in 1912, and has been renovated and improved repeatedly ever since. Its barrel vault and vast windows give the market an airiness and spaciousness, even when it’s crammed with shoppers. The steer’s head carved into the northern pediment may be a poignant thank you to the animals that have helped stock the market and feed Cleveland for a century.	This spectacular public market has got meat, fish, vegetables, baked goods, and enough kielbasa for a lifetime.
