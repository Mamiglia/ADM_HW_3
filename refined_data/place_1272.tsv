American Treasure Tour	{'museums and collections', 'collections', 'roadside attractions', 'museums'}	144	1235	They say one man’s trash is another man’s treasure, but in Pennsylvania’s American Treasure Tour it’s as though the concept of trash never even existed.\nConsisting of a collection of collections, the American Treasure Tour’s whiplash-inducing variations in content and interest are the work of a single, secret private collector. Located in a pristine, former tire factory the myriad nostalgia-inducing items number in the tens of thousands and are separated into related groups across the 100,000 square foot facility.\nThere are collections of beautifully restored self-playing orchestras, gangs of life-size clown statues, countless stuffed animals hailing from carnivals and promotional campaigns, decades worth of movie posters, grandfather clocks, porcelain dolls, nutcrackers, signs, and almost anything else one could imagine from the last century or more of cultural memory. There is even a full assortment of vintage automobiles.\nThe thing that sets the American Treasure Tour apart from its similar junk box rivals is how immaculately restored and preserved every piece in the collection is. The cars look like they just rolled off the factory line, the dolls look as though they were never played with, and almost all of the polished wooden music boxes still plays tunes. In fact many of them have been upgraded to play at the touch of a tour guide’s iPad.\n	Delicate Wurlitzers, creepy clowns, and The Noid all share space in this insane explosion of kitsch history.
