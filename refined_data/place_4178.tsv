Hisey Dinosaur Park	{'dinosaurs', 'animals', 'natural history'}	172	624	In 1993, the construction of small dinosaur statues was proposed as a means of attracting tourists to the small town. The first dinosaur was constructed in 1994, and the people of Granger have subsequently built nearly thirty of the sculptures in what has become an annual Dino-in-a-Day celebration.\nOriginally restricted to Hisey Park, in recent years more of the dinosaurs have been installed farther afield.\n	In Washington's Yakima Valley lies a town where dinosaurs roam.
