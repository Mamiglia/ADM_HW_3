Golden Bridge	{'art', 'engineering', 'design', 'bridges', 'architecture'}	89	706	Pictures of the fantastic Golden Bridge outside of Da Nang went viral as soon as they appeared online. This unique structure, backdropped by beautiful scenery, makes for a stunning sight, as if it was plucked from a fantasy world.\nThe giant hands supporting the bridge symbolize something divine, mythical, or godlike. It does look as though they are lifting the bridge as a gift from the ground. The bridge’s principle architect, Vu Viet Anh, has even said that the goal of the design was to “invoke the sensation of walking along a thread stretching through the hands of God.”\nBuilding the footbridge was an engineering challenge in order to not damage the cliff below and make the structure blend in with the forest around it. The hands are supported by frames modeled after anatomical structures and covered with decorative fiberglass. The position of each finger was carefully chosen to invoke the desired effect.\nIt’s no secret that the construction of the Golden Bridge is a part of a $2 billion investment to lure more tourists to the area. With a bridge this spectacular in such a stunning landscape, it might just succeed.	This spectacular bridge supported by two gigantic hands looks like something out of a fantasy universe.
