Doc Holliday's Grave	{'catacombs and crypts'}	516	948	Longtime friend and famous lawman Wyatt Earp had this to say about John Henry “Doc” Holliday:\n“Doc was a dentist not a lawman or an assassin, whom necessity had made a gambler; a gentleman whom disease had made a frontier vagabond; a philosopher whom life had made a caustic wit; a long lean ash-blond fellow nearly dead with consumption, and at the same time the most skillful gambler and the nerviest, speediest, deadliest man with a six-gun that I ever knew.”\nEarp’s quote encompasses Holliday so well that little remains to be said, except that one of history’s greatest Western characters also played a pivotal role during the shootout at the OK Corral in Tombstone, Arizona.\nEventually he died of tuberculosis at the Glenwood Springs sanitarium. As he laid in bed, he spoke his last words: “Well, I’ll be damned. This is funny,” referencing his barefoot state, for no one had anticipated Doc meeting Death in such a relaxed fashion.\nToday, his headstone can be viewed in the Linwood Cemetery in which he is buried, though the exact spot of his plot remains unknown.	Even in death, he's still your huckleberry.
